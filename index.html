FGM has been shown to prevent, yet no one is beating down the door claiming we should cut women in the US. Men without foreskin are missing langerhans cells which can kill hiv in healthy individuals if they are exposed. Keep in mind that reuse of needles and poor health care conditions in various locations are big issues with regard to the spread of hiv. Men with out all their nerves, which foreskin has, tend to avoid condoms, too bc of the lack of sensation. This raises the chance of transmission. They also leave tiny tears in their partners due to the dry and calloused glans which makes it easier for the partner to get any STI if exposed. I am really tired of the #misandry #lies #myths you all perpetuate. http://www.washingtonpost.com/.../03/05/AR2007030500357.html</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Anonymous Anonymous</td><td>Dec 3, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0005'>Permalink</a></td><td>Even though circumcision is NOT medical treatment, your less than informed statement makes it APPEAR to be treatment. So let me explain which laws you're in violation of.. the most simple and important of all is the Constitutional right the Bodily integrity, and why the CDC is in VIOLATION of their mission statement, "Saving lives, Protecting People, by recommend forced infant genital mutilation. With this statement the CDC is in fact JEOPARDIZING public health.
      Definitions:
      Circumcision: The surgical removal of the foreskin of the penis or prepuce.
      Battery: an intentional unpermitted act causing harmful or offensive contact with the "person" of another.
      Forced infant circumcision is battery.
      It is intentionally done by the physician, assistant, mohel, or other persons.
      It is unpermitted by the individual who is being assaulted.
      It is harmful, removing functional, healthy tissue.
      You are criminal conspirators. Expect phone calls, public outcry and legal involvement in the interest of non-consenting children.
      In 1986, case Belchertown State Sch. V. Saikewicz a Supreme Court declared a patient have the right to refuse treatment for any reason.
      in 2010 Stouffer v Reid, "We explained that 'fountainhead of the doctrine [of informed consent] is the patient's right to exercise control over his own body, ...by deciding for himself [or herself] whether or not to submit to the particular therapy.'
      The list continues including critical cases like the 2006 Boldt V. Boldt a Supreme court ruled that the child has the right to declare if he undergoes surgery, specifically the type of genital mutilation that is commonly known as Circumcision.
      If the CDC continues to declare that this form of genital mutilation has benefits they will be in direct opposition to and in complete refusal to acknowledge existing medical evidence supporting the contrary, that men and their partners are at a GREATER risk of contracting STD's and HIV if the man is CIRCUMCISED.
      38 MD's, 24 holding Doctorates, medical professionals from around the world came together to produce an informed professional statement, declaring, with evidence, that forced infant genital mutilation is harmful the boy the man and his partners. Find that here:

      "There is growing consensus among
      physicians, including those in the
      United States, that physicians should
      discourage parents from circumcising

Ignoring the many flaws in coming to the conclusion that circumcision magically prevents the spread of HIV and STI's, it is completely irrelevant when deciding to remove a healthy part of a baby boy's genitals. If he comes of age and decides to amputate part of his penis and still have to use a condom to prevent getting STIs, all the more power to him. Also, the CDC has disregarded that the foreskin and frenulum are healthy, functional parts of the penis and how majorely downplayed the risks, which there are many. Shame on the CDC for putting out such a biased statement.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Anonymous Anonymous</td><td>Dec 3, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0007'>Permalink</a></td><td>FIRST!</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Anonymous Anonymous</td><td>Dec 3, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0008'>Permalink</a></td><td>Circumcision is a procedure to remove a functioning organ from a non consenting minor. It's un-ethical and the benefits do not out weigh the risks. Where are the studies showing the infant mortality from circumcision? Also what about all the foreskin functions... why are they not included?

You recommend a permanent, life-long disfigurement as a protective method against an already drastically low rate of infection? Why not encourage proper intact care, recommending that pediatricians be brought up to date on knowing not to forcefully retract? Why not mention to the parents about the increased risk of ED later in life? Why not mention that the American Cancer Society states that circumcision is not an effective means of preventing penile cancer? Your power struggle is at the cost of innocent people, boys that have no say. Why aren't our boys deserving the same rights of protection of our girls? Higher rates of appendicitis, but they aren't routinely removed.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Amanda Garlow</td><td>Dec 3, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0010'>Permalink</a></td><td>Before I comment, I think it's important to note that I am at a disadvantage as an advocate for leaving infant foreskin intact. There is no way for me to back up an argument emphasizing the function of foreskin because there is little legitimately unbiased scientific study on the matter. If I quote information from anti-circ organizations, the information appears slanted and easy to discredit. Scientific journals are full of polls asking men if they're satisfied with being circumcised/intact, which does not constitute valid scientific research. There is inherent bias and no control data in an opinion poll when there is no frame of reference for respondents. (A circumcised male can never know whether he would be happier intact because he has never experienced that, and an intact male can never know whether he would be happier circumcised for the same reason.) I even have to be careful of my rhetoric. If I use semantically neutral language, such as "intact," or call circumcision what it is - forced genital cutting - I appear biased simply because in the U.S. circumcision is the norm. That being said, I will do my best to provide a valid, unbiased argument against circumcision with supporting evidence given these handicaps.

      Firstly, studies supporting the effectiveness of circumcision in preventing certain STDs have been cherry picked. Other studies have been conducted that showed no difference, even in locations where HIV contraction rates are extremely high:

      "To settle this issue, three trials were set up in sub-Saharan Africa, which together involved more than 11,000 previously uncircumcised men. (7) Each man was randomly assigned to one of two categories: one group had their foreskins removed at the start of the study and the others remained uncircumcised. All men received extensive counselling on HIV prevention and risk reduction techniques. During the trials, researchers collected information about the mens sexual behaviour to check whether it varied between the two groups; they found no significant differences." (http://www.avert.org/male-circumcision.htm#sthash.YYvH1ksM.dpuf)

      Secondly, by our government's own admission, circumcision is a painful procedure administered without pain management for the infant, which means it is at best unethical to perform it without distinct cause. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0012623/)

      Thirdly, there are many far more effective methods of preventing STDs, particularly HIV, that do not involve ethically questionable surgical intervention. Condom use has been shown to be at least 80 percent effective in preventing the spread of HIV, while in even the most optimistic of studies circumcision only had a 50 percent success rate.

      Finally, UNAIDS and WHO recommend that circumcision be used as a preventative method in countries with high prevalence of HIV and other STDs. "High prevalence" is defined as above 3 percent of the general population, which includes many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. (http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/basics/ataglance.html) No western country has an infection rate above 3 percent, despite circumcision rates being lower than 20 percent in most European countries. (http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/malecircumcision/infopack_en_2.pdf)

      Propagating the recommendation to encourage routine infant circumcision would be devastating step backward for pediatric care in the United States. That fact that a procedure can prevent spread of illness is not enough justification for its recommendation if it violates the immediate bodily autonomy and long-term healthy function of the child. If continually backed by the scientific community, this notice will be heavily misinterpreted and cited, especially in the United States, as justification for unnecessary genital cutting.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Anonymous Anonymous</td><td>Dec 3, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0011'>Permalink</a></td><td>CDC, Big time FAIL on your part. Encouraging mutilating baby boys because of studies done in a 3rd world countries on sexually active men in a nation with different sexual and hygiene practices??? Are you insane? It's all about the money, isn't it? Shame, shame on you. Because of this there will be an increase of parents violating their son's human rights by cutting healthy flesh from their bodies. Disgusting. Expect to see a lot of outrage now and in years to come when these babies grow up into men who resent their mutilations and blame you.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Lindsey D</td><td>Dec 3, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0012'>Permalink</a></td><td>How many men will now believe that they are immune to HIV simply because they are circumcised? How many of those men will give up the use of condoms based on those ideas of "protection"? With these recommendations, the CDC will help to bring about a new surge in the epidemic.

      http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2064110/

      "A suspected entry route for HIV turns out to be a dead-end, report Lot de Witte, Teunis Geijtenbeek (VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands), and colleagues. Langerhans cells [found in the foreskin of the penis], rather than transmitting the virus to T cells, trap HIV-1 and thus act as a barrier to infection."

      Where are your recommendations based on these findings indicating that the foreskin is full of specialized cells that form an important barrier to HIV infection?

      Why on earth should anyone believe that studies done in Africa would be applicable to the population of the United States?

      Further examples of flaws from those African studies:

      "All three of the clinical trials conducted in sub-Saharan Africa were terminated early. More than 700 participants were lost to follow-up, their HIV status unknown; i.e., 4.5 times more participants were lost to follow-up than were reported to have been protected from HIV by circumcision. The study participants were paid, provided free condoms, and given extensive education and counseling, thus limiting the real world applicability of the studies."

      "No consideration was given to the probability that a significant number of HIV infections were contracted through means other than sexual conduct, calling into question the entire premise of the RCTs."

      "All three RCTs were halted earlier than designed, including a study investigating the effect upon female infections. In one study, circumcised mens infection rates were increasing toward the intact mens rate prior to the study being halted. Following the study period, all participants in the control group were then offered circumcision, eliminating the possibility of any accurate follow-up study."

      http://www.intactamerica.org/sites/default/files/IASummaryAtlanta.pdf

      Give us an explanation for these recommendations that shows how these recommendations are not simply another example of American cultural bias, please. How many of the decision makers here are circumcised men? Let the public be aware.

      One last question- since the United States has such a high incidence of circumcision, why does it also have such a high rate of HIV infection? Especially as compared to Europe (with an almost non-existent circumcision rate)? We are waiting for answers.

The trajectory of human history has always been the struggle between tyranny and freedom. Our founding fathers thought they had established a free nation that would sustain its freedom through our constitutional guarantees. They did not count on the cunning and cruelty of the circumcision superstition, nor did they envision that our nation's doctors would sneak it into our culture as medicine. Now the Federal Government has made its most arrogant venture into the circumcision wars, with a new Centers for Disease Control initiative to support the failing policy of the American Academy of Pediatrics. I do not view this as a setback in the slightest. It's a sign of their desperation, that the American people are rejecting the bloody penis surgery that has wounded generations of our sons, and the people who love them. A faceless bureaucrat at the CDC cannot alter the course of history. We are a free people in the process of fighting off yet another tyranny in the cruel history of mankind. http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896.full.pdf+html</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Sharlee Ashley</td><td>Dec 3, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0014'>Permalink</a></td><td>I urge the CDC to revoke their stance on circumcision. Not only is routine infant circumcision unethical because it is performing an unnecessary amputation of healthy tissue, it is a violation of human rights because it is performed on a non consenting minor without diagnostic value or a diagnosis.
      The foreskin is a valuable piece of the male genitalia and serves many purposes including protection and erogenous function. The argument that circumcision protects against HIV is invalid because even circumcised men absolutely must wear a condom to prevent transmission of HIV. It also brings up the question of how valid these finding are since most sexually active men in the US are circumcised, however we have astronomical rates of HIV in the country. Even the CDC states that circumcision only reduces risk by 60%. I don't know know about you but I would not take the 40% chance of contracting HIV AND still lose about 15 square inches of the most erogenous tissue in my body. It doesn't make sense that a healthy organ would function better with a part of it missing.
      Many will argue that intact boys are at higher risk for UTI's and infection. However, this is not the case when there is proper care of the intact penis. Intact infants and boys should never have their foreskin retracted as it creates micro-tears as the foreskin it attached to the glans. This introduces bacteria and is the number one cause of infection. Also, females are 5 times more likely to get UTI's or infection, but removing the clitoral hood or labia of an infant female would be seen and unethical and extreme. The case is identical to that of male circumcision.
      As a future nurse, I refuse to take part of any practice of circumcision as it is directly a violation of medical ethics. I will never recommend it and always speak to parents about how barbaric and unnecessary it is. I am extremely disappointed on the cultural biases stance that the CDC has taken on circumcision as no ETHICAL health organization in the world recxomends infant circumcision and there are even countries that are in proceeds of banning it all together.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Anonymous Anonymous</td><td>Dec 3, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0015'>Permalink</a></td><td>My body, my right.

They have the right to keep their healthy genitals, as nature made them, to use as they see fit when they are adults. Any removal, alteration, cutting or mutilating of healthy sexual tissue from a CHILD is wrong. Adults should not be determining how much genitalia a child should have. They need to grow up with whole, healthy bodies to have the sex life that nature allows them to have, not one dictated by someone else. The only way to prevent or reduce the transmission of STIs and HIV is to 1. Not have sex with a person infected with an STI or HIV 2. Always use some barrier method when having sex (Condoms or Dental Dams) with another person 3. Get tested regularly and insist that your partner be tested regularly also 4. Have monogamous and exclusive sexual relations 5.

A condemnation due to cultural bias and flawed methodology was even published in the journal Pediatrics. That file can be found here:

      http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896.full.pdf

      The CDC is now following in the AAP's flawed footsteps. No medical organization in the world recommends that circumcision be performed routinely on newborns. In 2010, the The Royal Australasian College of Physician issued a statement saying, "After reviewing the currently available evidence, the RACP believes that the frequency of diseases modifiable by circumcision, the level of protection offered by circumcision and the complication rates of circumcision do not warrant routine infant circumcision in Australia and New Zealand." In Finland, The Central Union for Child Welfare has issued a strong statement in opposition to the proposal to offer ritual circumcision in public hospitals.The Netherlands has also taken a strong stance. The Royal Dutch Medical Society published a seventeen-page position statement in English regarding the circumcision of male childen on May 27, 2010. That statement cites many problems of male circumcision and says that the operation violates the human rights of the child. It goes on to say that the KNMG would not oppose making the circumcision of male children unlawful. The document is available in a PDF file on the KNMG website.

      It is time the CDC also factored in ethical concerns into their statement. Adult males can provide informed consent, so long as they are presented with all of the facts, including the potential risks and harms of circumcision. Newborn males cannot. Accepted bioethical principles dictate that proxy (e.g., parental) consent is limited to interventions where the childs health or life is at risk. This is not the case with infant circumcision an elective surgical procedure that permanently removes healthy, functional tissue from a healthy baby. Furthermore, it is concerning that circumcision is being encouraged as a method to reduce HIV transmission. This may encourage men to engage in risky behavior, if they are under the false assumption that their risk of HIV transmission is low. The CDC statement may potentially mislead many circumcised men.

      The CDC has a lot to answer to. Why aren't these studies being performed in America? The majority of the male population is circumcised here, yet the CDC states "CDC estimates that 1,201,100 persons aged 13 years and older are living with HIV infection, including 168,300 (14%) who are unaware of their infection".</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Anonymous Anonymous</td><td>Dec 3, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0018'>Permalink</a></td><td>Even though circumcision is NOT medical treatment, your less than informed statement makes it APPEAR to be treatment.

      Circumcision amputates significant amounts of erogenous tissue, and many more nerve endings than are found in the female clitoris. No medical society outside of the United States of America recommends circumcision. Several legal scholars have come to the consensus that this is genital mutilation and is already against the law.

It violates the child's rights to bodily autonomy. Foreskin is not a birth defect. To imply the "benefits outweigh the risk"- is deceiving. First- a risk is DEATH, loss of penis, adhesions, skin grafts, complications continue- not to mention the thousands of sexual nerve endings that are lost. As health care professionals we make an oath to "first do no harm". The foreskin is not diseased and therefore amputation is not a consideration. As stated before "foreskin is normal". Penile cancer is very rare- and an individual can still get penile cancer regardless of if they have foreskin or not. Also- a male is more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer- what will be next? The removal of breast buds from baby males and females? One out of eight women have breast cancer- why not "prophylatically" remove their breast buds to "maybe/possibly" save them from breast cancer? UTIs- women have much more issues with UTIs, will you release a statement to make infant girl circumcision legal again? This is a human rights violation. Foreskin is meant to be on the body. HIV/stds- America has the highest rates of circumcision and the highest rates of HIV/stds when compared to countries that do not circumcise. Please show my the research that is not flawed, also done in a country where they have no sex education. Why not prove your study in developed countries? Also, how is a condom over a circumcised penis more protective than a condom over a penis with foreskin?

      This is going to be one huge mistake in the history books if you come out with this guideline. No health organization in the entire world recommends circumcision of infant males- do you really want to be the one and only?

Same outcome because the tissue overlaps where bacteria may grow are removed if we want to be clinical about it.

      We, as a society, have come a long way in terms of hygiene. Daily washing and care have done far more to keep males healthy than submitting to male penile surgery. Why that is not the CDCs recommendation is beyond comprehension.

      And while statistical data may, no doubt, reflect reduced cases of STD transmission in circumcised males, a condom is far more effective at reducing transmission by eliminating contact of bodily fluids during sexual activity altogether. The very fact that surgery is recommended as the primary method of STD transmission reduction is insane. The outcome of this recommendation will be additional unwanted pregnancies, a higher chance of STD transmission than compare with condom use as two major negatives. Surgery, of course, has risks associated with it that condoms do not.

      Should this draft become be the CDC's final recommendation then I can only assume that female labia removal be following shortly behind as a recommended female STD reduction technique. How barbaric of a procedure in order to reduce STD transmission by 50% when other, non-surgical methods are available that have considerably higher prevention rates while having zero risk to the male as no surgical procedure is necessary.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Aimee mcnulty</td><td>Dec 3, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0023'>Permalink</a></td><td>It is unethical to permanently alter the body of an unconsenting child unless it is absolutely necessary.

      Within the United States, population data does not show that there is any HIV (or STDs) risk advantage for men that have had the genital cutting surgery (GCS). Should not all guidelines as to GSC be based on what US population data shows? Please consider the NAVY study and others that show NO HIV, HPV or STD difference as to American males with natural genitals and American males that have had GSC.

      Your material mentions a lower rate of HIV (and STDs) infection for men that had the genital cutting surgery (GCS). This appears to be based on Africa studies (AS), and not US population Data. There must be some consideration as to why Africa population data a does not match the AS. Also, as the US population data does not show the 50-60% risk change stated by the AS, this must be considered and addressed. It must be considered if the AS is based on other factors such as condom use/ of condom advice or some other bias This must be addressed or the AS must a least be discarded as not applicable to the US population.

      The CDC must address the glaring issue that men in the EU mostly have natural genitals and a majority of men in the US have had GSC and the EU has much lower HIV, HPV and STD rates than the US. Although the HIV STDs rates of men in the US with natural genitals and men that have had GCS is the best data (our own population), the EU and US comparison indicates that men that have had GCS are at a higher risk of HIV and STDs. This must be considered and addressed.

      Your material mentions benefits of GCS and risks. However, there is no analysis of:

      The harm to infant/boy of loss of protective aspects of tissue amputated.
      Loss of nerve endings from the tissue amputated.
      Loss of mobile erogenous tissue.
      Affects on sexual pleasure and function related to the tissue amputated.
      Erectile dysfunction related to the tissue amputated.
      Premature ejaculation related to the tissue amputated.
      Changes to dynamics of coitus related to the tissue amputated.
      Changes as to masturbation related to the tissue amputated.

      Please make sure that each of these points is fully considered and addressed. Obviously, there can be no consideration of the risks of MGCS if changes to sexual pleasure and function of the amputated tissue and loss of nerve endings related to the tissue amputated are never even considered.</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>C R</td><td>Dec 3, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0032'>Permalink</a></td><td>Also this:

Lesotho
In Lesotho, 23% of the men are circumcised, and the ratio circumcised men vs. intact men who contracted HIV was 22.8 vs 15.2.

"The relationship between male circumcision and HIV levels in Lesotho does not conform to the expected pattern of higher rates among uncircumcised men than circumcised men. The HIV rate is in fact substantially higher among circumcised men (23 percent) than among men who are not circumcised (15 percent). Moreover, the pattern of higher infection rates among circumcised men compared with uncircumcised men is virtually uniform across the various subgroups for which results are shown in the table. This finding could be explained by the Lesotho custom to conduct male circumcision later in life, when the individuals have already been exposed to the risk of HIV infection. (Additional analysis is necessary to better understand the unexpected pattern in Table 12.9.)" (p. 13)

What is disturbing here is that it seems researchers grope for a reason to dismiss these results because they are not what they are looking for; a positive result for circumcision. The above is an interesting defense of male circumcision, given the fact that the latest "studies," if they can even be called that, observed HIV transmission in men circumcised as adults. Then again, this demographic health survey was conducted in 2004, BEFORE the newer "studies" in 2006. None the less, the unproven assertion that "circumcision is only effective in reducing the risk of HIV when done in infancy" persists in some circles.

In Malawi, 20% of the male population is circumcised. The ratio of circumcised vs. intact men who contracted HIV was 13.2 vs 9.5.

"The relationship between HIV prevalence and circumcision status is not in the expected direction.

In Malawi, the majority of men are not circumcised (80 percent)(...where one would expect HIV to be the most rampant... note the "expected direction.") (p. 10)

Swaziland
In a recent demographic health survey (2006-2007), the ratio of circumcised vs. intact men who contracted HIV was found to be 22 vs. 20.

As Table 14.10 shows, the relationship between HIV prevalence and circumcision status is not in the expected direction. Circumcised men have a slightly higher HIV infection rate than men who are not circumcised (22 percent compared with 20 percent). (p. 256)

Here is that "expected direction" again. The majority of Swazi men are uncircumcised, and one would especially expect to see HIV prevalence here. HIV transmission was more prevalent in the circumcised men here, yet the US government has decided to spend millions on a campaign to circumcise 80% of the men in Swaziland.

In Malaysia, most, if not all Muslim men are circumcised, whereas circumcision is uncommon in the non-Muslim community. 60% of the Malaysian population is Muslim, which means that HIV is spreading in the community where most men are circumcised at an even faster rate, than in the community where most men are intact.

Among all countries in Asia, only the Philippines and Bangladesh are reporting increases in HIV cases, with others either stable or decreasing.

Any other elective procedure or surgery would be considered highly unethical to perform without consent of the person undergoing the procedure (i.e. the patient/child). This should not be a procedure that is pushed on parents or even offered to parents because it is completely unnecessary. It is a decision that should be saved for the person who would undergo the elective, cosmetic change. Instead parents should be given information about how to properly care for their child's whole body. They should be thoroughly informed of the risks of circumcision if they request the procedure to be done, just like any surgery or procedure where risks are involved. Parents should also be informed about the many functions of the foreskin that they are electing to have removed. There are better, less invasive ways of reducing the risks of HIV, STI's, and other infections, including condoms and proper hygiene. These interventions require only education instead of permanently removing a healthy, normal, functioning part of the body without the patient's consent.

The American Cancer Society has stated that circumcision is not an effective way to prevent against penile cancer. Circumcised males can and still do get penile cancer. In addition, the penile cancer rates are far less than the rates for breast cancer (as an example) in males (and females) but suggesting prophylactic amputation of the breast tissue in infancy/childhood to prevent breast cancer would obviously be considered highly unethical. The rates for penile cancer are also far less than the rates for any cancer of the vulva, however again there are no prophylactic procedures being done to prevent that in women. In fact female circumcision was made illegal in the United States in 1997. Boys deserve the same kind of protection from unnecessary, elective procedures..

I would like to see organizations such as the CDC and AAP standing up for what is in the best interest of the patient, upholding higher ethical standards, and remembering "First Do No Harm." When it comes to circumcision, it is not a patient centered act. It is a parent and physician centered act. Medical professionals should think, "what would the patient want?" And if the patient themselves cannot consent to an elective procedure, it is completely unethical to perform that procedure on the patient. It is appalling that the CDC is taking this stance as other nations across the globe are only getting closer to making infant circumcision illegal.</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>Donald Rhodes Rhodes</td><td>Dec 3, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0036'>Permalink</a></td><td>If the CDC doesn't know that the 60% reduction in HIV is statistical sleight of hand and that the actual % reduction from the African studies is 1.3%, then I am concerned for the state of American medicine.

I am glad that the CDC is asking for public opinion on their recommendations regarding elective male circumcision.

I am in favor of personal choice in all issues pertaining to one's body. I believe adult males should receive information about elective circumcision, including the potential health benefits and risks of the procedure, because adults have the right to and the ability to make decisions about their own bodies. However, I strongly oppose the idea of an elective procedure being performed on someone who is not able to consent to it.

"The analysis sample consisted of 1059 uncircumcised and 310 circumcised men. For the glans penis, circumcised men reported decreased sexual pleasure and lower orgasm intensity. They also stated more effort was required to achieve orgasm, and a higher percentage of them experienced unusual sensations (burning, prickling, itching, or tingling and numbness of the glans penis). For the penile shaft a higher percentage of circumcised men described discomfort and pain, numbness and unusual sensations. In comparison to men circumcised before puberty, men circumcised during adolescence or later indicated less sexual pleasure at the glans penis, and a higher percentage of them reported discomfort or pain and unusual sensations at the penile shaft."

" a childrens rights analysis suggests that non-consensual, non-therapeutic circumcision of boys, whatever the circumstances, constitutes a gross violation of their rights, including the right to physical integrity, to freedom of thought and religion and to protection from physical and mental violence. When extreme complications arise, it may violate the right to life. It is reported that male circumcision can result in numerous physical, psychological, and sexual health problems during the surgery, afterwards, and throughout adulthood, including haemorrhage, panic attacks, erectile dysfunction, infection (in severe forms leading to partial or complete loss of the penis), urinary infections, necrosis, permanent injury or loss of the glans, excessive penile skin loss,
external deformity, and in some cases even death."

"The WHO review quoted three randomized controlled trials suggesting that circumcision reduces the risk of acquiring HIV infection in males. But this potential health benefit does not over-ride a childs right to give informed consent to the practice. The decision to undertake circumcision for these reasons can be deferred to a time where the risk is relevant and the child is old enough to choose and consent for himself."

It is unethical and considered mutilation to circumcise a female, but it's perfectly okay to circumcise a male? According to other Health Organizations, the AAP stance is completely misleading and ill - informed. Over 70% of the world's population of the male gender is intact. In civilized countries where RIC is not performed, they have a significant decrease in penile illnesses such as STD's and STI's. They understand that proper intact care, as well as, the use of condoms is wonderfully helpful. Peoples of other countries do not have the illnesses that our circumcised American men have, because by removing the foreskin, you are removing the protection of the penis and it's glans. It also decreases sexual pleasure and function, and this is why the very FEW countries who circumcise their children also have the highest rates of HIV/Aids, as well as, a dangerously high usage of Viagra. This is to be expected if one knows the value, purpose, and functions of a foreskin and why it is there. This supposedly new result of the so called "study" is a mirroring of the 2012 statement from the AAP. It is very well known that the people behind the AAP are also behind this as well, so it is obvious that this is going to replicate the myths that's been debunked many times before. It is discouraging to know that Americans, the people within the country of intelligence, is very far from such. I am surprised that with all the information in the world in regards to genital mutilation, we have the CDC spewing debunked myths and promoting such as facts. While the long term effects have not been studied in the USA, because circumcision forced upon newborns is a money maker and doctors earn approximately 100,000.00 dollars more just from circumcisions per year. These are far from being opinions, and can be clearly proven as facts. You have many doctors in the USA who do not understand the foreskin in general, because in Medical School they are taught one thing, and that is to remove it. 3 out of 50 Medical Text books actually inform students of the foreskin. Also, to simply state that circumcision's benefits outweigh the risks, one must educate themselves on the risks. 1 out of 5 babies will suffer from staph infections. Approximately 120 babies die a year from complications that could not be rectified. Botched circumcisions happen often, as well as, the whole penis being mistakenly amputated. So many more "mistakes" occur, because doctors are motivated by the money involved rather than the actual well being of the child. I honestly feel that if we were to conduct studies, than we need to see what the other countries are doing that is factually working wonders for them literally. As they don't cut their children, and miraculously the child becomes a man with his whole penis, and never has issues. Please consider this, and make necessary changes. The most common reasons for issues on an intact penis is because health officials misinform the parents on care. You do not forcibly retract the foreskin, not even a little bit, to clean it. You just wipe it like a finger and clean what is seen. During bath time, you wash with warm water on the genitals. That is it. Forceful retraction tears the connective tissues, causes adhesions, infections, pain, bleeding, scarring, as well as many other issues. That will indeed cause an intact male to be circumcised. So it all does come back to you, the CDC. The cancer society states to not circumcise a child to prevent penile cancer. However, you say differently. Penile cancer is extremely rare as approximately 1 out of 800,000 males will ever get that. Also, penile cancer has nothing to do with foreskin and starts elsewhere that is not even close to the foreskin. So your misinformation is misleading the public, for your own financial gain.

I believe that the medical establishment here is aware of this and that is why the AAP issued its statement when they did, with the bottom line of their position being that third party payers/insurance companies should cover RIC. Insurance companies are now notifying customers of the procedures they are newly covering, and, quelle surprise, circumcision has been added to the list.

By saying that circumcision is better for the child because it marginally reduces std transmission rates is like saying "well if you completely remove the penis, there is virtually a 0% chance of ever catching an std"

I was circumcised at birth and I greatly wish that I was not. My parents signed a form that gave a doctor permission to remove a part of my body. I did not consent to this and I will not tolerate it being done to my children. Circumcision is an outdated practice that is largely unpopular in the rest of the world with the exception of the usa and Israel.

Fact: no medical organization in the world recommends infant circumcision.
Fact: the foreskin serves an important purpose, protecting the glans, an internal organ, just as the eyelid protects the eye. In removing the foreskin, the sensitive glans becomes an external organ, resulting in countless *side effects*, many not seen until puberty, including narrowing of the meatus (which can and does result in repetitive uti's), stretching and splitting of the shaft skin during erection, painful erections and erectile dysfunction.
Fact: no study in an industrialized nation has been able to repeat studies showing HIV reduction rates in cut men.
Fact: every male mammal is born with a foreskin and only American human males are said to be born with defective body parts requiring immediate surgery on healthy tissue.

Fact: human males have a higher risk of breast cancer than penile cancer. If cancer was that much of a concern, you would be recommending breast buds in male infants be removed as well.

Let's call a spade a spade, this isn't about health or cleanliness. It's about money.

Condoms prevent STI's. Whether intact or cut, cdc will tell a man to wear a condom. So why recommend removing 15 square inches of adult tissue, with over 20,000 nerve endings and more than 16 important functions.

One passage of the supplementary information I find particularly egregious is the following: "Such decision making [regarding circumcision] is made in the context of not only health considerations, but also other social, cultural, ethical, and religious factors."

I do not think United States physicians should be in the business of involuntary surgery for the sake of "social, cultural or religious factors." To me, that is reminiscent the female genital mutilation seen in Africa, where females' genitals are cut because of "social, cultural or religious factors." That being said, it should be made clear that the majority of female circumcision is far more severe, though this should not foster apathy regarding the ethics of male circumcision.

If a young boy feels compelled to be circumcised in order to fulfill cultural norms, I think he should be counseled to learn to accept, love and appreciate his natural body, not counseled to be convinced of the "benefits" of the procedure.

The conversation regarding circumcision in the United States often centers around "benefits" and "risks" though seldom do any US reports mention the functions of the foreskin. The foreskin offers protection for the glans from becoming desensitized and forming a layer of keratin that reduces sensitivity. The foreskin itself is highly innervated with thousands of fine-touch nerve endings, the exact number of which is unknown. In terms of mechanical function, it provides a natural lubricant and gliding motion, reducing pain and abrasion for both partners during intercourse.

As an adult male, I regret that my infant circumcision was performed on me, even more so that it was done for religious reasons. There is always a chance that a child will regret their involuntary circumcision, and they can never get back that innervated tissue. On the other hand, if an adult male is regretful that his penis was left intact, he can always have the procedure done as an adult, and be cut exactly the way he wants, while infants' foreskins are cut however the doctor chooses to do so.

The CDC website itself lists the risk of HIV transmission from receptive and insertive penile-vaginal intercourse at rates of .08% and .04% respectively. If condoms are used, HIV transmission is negligible. Circumcision may be seen by some as a justification for having unsafe sex.

Europe generally has much lower rates of circumcision, yet their rates of HIV and STI transmission tend to be lower as well.

Regarding general hygiene, smegma is found in both male and female genitalia and is easily washed away with water.

I have no doubt that the majority of healthcare professionals who read this will see it as a radical fringe opinion, I see it as fulfillment of the Hippocratic Oath with "utmost respect for human life from its beginning." Ablation of healthy living tissue from a baby boy's penis is no way to welcome him into the world.

I commend the CDC for not blatantly recommending routine infant circumcision, though I believe the "benefits and risks" of the procedure should be reevaluated while taking into the account with the many functions and benefits of the foreskin.

Cancer reduction? Penile cancer is caused by HPV, which there is a vaccine to prevent now. In addition, it is so rare, that most urologists will never see a case of cancer of the penis in their entire career. This is absurd.

HIV risk reduction? I don't believe that a group of Africans who have different cultural traditions between those being circumcised and those not being circumcised, along with the motivations of those getting circumcised possibly affecting their risky behavior, is remotely relevant to the behavior of men in the United States regarding HIV prevention. In addition, these adult men chose to have the procedure done, unlike infants, who cannot give informed consent on their own body being radically modified with no way to undo this procedure. Please look at other cultures around the world where circumcision is not common and their rate of infection is not radically different than this country where circumcision is prevalent and is actually lower than what we find in the United States.

If there are benefits to circumcision, which I do not believe come close to outweighing the damage done, please recommend it for adults rather than infants.

But we don't do it because that would be morally wrong.

The same principles apply here- we could perform hundreds of preemptive surgeries on our children to help lower their chances of ever having anything go wrong in their bodies- but how much do you removed (well-intentioned, obviously) before it becomes wrong?

North America, and the United States in particular, has the highest rate of non-therapeutic circumcision in the world. If circumcision prevented HIV, by up to 60% (!), North America would have the lowest prevalence of HIV infection of any developed region. The prevalence of HIV infection in North America is .6% vs Western and Central Europe, and Eastern Europe and Central Asia- which both sit at .2% http://www.avert.org/worldwide-hiv-aids-statistics.htm

STI rates are about equal between North America and Western Europe. Again, shouldn't North America have a much lower rate? http://www.avert.org/std-statistics-worldwide.htm

Another factor is that the United States interest in circumcision is profit-driven. Routine Infant Circumcision is a double-dip profit machine, by charging for both the surgery and the sale of tissue that has been removed (not one penny of which goes to the patient the tissue was removed from).

I am the father of an uncircumcised son. All information that was provided to me regarding circumcision for the birth of my son was devoid of critically important information. That information is this; circumcision is unnecessary and has negative consequences on the adult male sexual experience. While the incidence of short term complications have been deemed outweighed by the benefits, I have found no good measure of long term complications. There was no real discussion of this with medical staff pertaining to my son, as it was generally brushed of as "rare". This is not statistically verified. As a case of one I offer this; I suffer from painfully tight erections that have been diagnosed as the removal of too much skin during my circumcision. This is relevant to everyone. It is very relevant to me. My adult sexual life has been spent in pain, because of an unnecessary procedure that I did not choose. When I had sex before I married, I used a condom for my protection and I never contracted an STI. A condom protected me with far greater that 50-60% that circumcision reports, and it is still the stance of the CDC to use a condom for sexual encounters.

Circumcision did not protect me. Sound advice of condom use protected me. Circumcision harmed me in a way that no doctor, who ever discussed it with me regarding my son, feels is relevant. That, is wrong. This is not a procedure without harm. To recommend that parent do this to their son is a disservice to all males. Offering this service to adult males who can consent I feel is an acceptable practice. I may have unknowingly taken it up myself, had it not been done to me. However, in no way do I support a recommendation of circumcising an infant. A man's sexual experience belongs to him. This I know, for I have never owned my own sexual experience. That was stolen from me. My sexual experience has always been compromised by a decision made for me 19 years before I had it.

The long term negative consequences are certainly enough to not make this a recommended procedure on children. They most certainly must be addressed in every conversation of the topic and cannot be dismissed as "rare". This is not a procedure to be forced upon someone, it is an elective procedure that can be made by a willing adult.</td></tr><tr><td>75</td><td>James Anonymous</td><td>Dec 4, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0075'>Permalink</a></td><td>Where is the proof that cutting off parts of a male human's penis absolutely reduces the risks associated with this CDC statement.

The documented changes on the brain during infant circumcision affect those areas of the brain that deal with emotion, perception, and reasoning due to the intense pain having a negative effect on the forming infants brain.

Please reconsider your stance on this very important issue. Research this throughly, do not just base this on the AAP. Are you aware 75-80% of the men in the world are intact (not circumcised) and do not suffer from any "foreskin problems" or have high rates of HIV/STDs. America (which has the highest rate of sexually active circumcised males) has over 1 million adults infected with HIV, as well as 110 million adults with contacted STD's. Yet non-circumcising countries, such as Finland, have a substantially lower rate of HIV/STD's. Finland has a less than 1% circumcision rate, yet only has 2,900 adults infected with HIV, and only 1 million adults with contracted STDs. Please explain how America, with a huge majority of sexually active males being circumcised, has one of the highest rates of HIV/STDs in the world, while non-circumcising countries have the lowest rates?? If circumcision did "prevent" these diseases, why are they so rampant in this country??

Circumcision does not prevent the spread of HIV/STDs. Condoms do. Please retract this statement right away and stop trying to use scare tactics on innocent parents.</td></tr><tr><td>88</td><td>Daniel Kucich</td><td>Dec 4, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0088'>Permalink</a></td><td>I have taken it upon myself to write a piece of satire that is meant to both entertain and illustrate an ethical complexity lacking in the CDC's position. It is much easier to spot a human rights violation that occurs in an outside culture than it is to identify one in your very own. Without further ado, I present to you my allegory. In the year 2049, the UK health administration concluded that the partial removal of the back of the tongue in newborns would virtually eliminate the transfer of mononucleosis, the highly contagious and damaging kissing disease. Patients can expect to feel minor pain during and after the procedure, and in some cases swelling of the tongue may pose a minor concern that can be easily treated with an anti-inflammatory or a cold compress. It is not suspected that this treatment will result in difficulty breastfeeding. The time to fully recover will take anywhere from 10 to 15 days, after which time all possible ill effects should subside. As the child matures, he or she will be fully capable of eating any and all solid foods. No difference in taste buds will occur with the minor exception of sensing sourness. Since several of the sensors responsible for detecting acidic flavors will naturally be absent as a result of the excision, some fruits such as apples and grapefruit may produce a milder sensation against the eater's palette. It must be stressed that all infants who undergo this procedure will still be able to gain full satisfaction from eating. The receptors for sweetness, saltiness, and even bitterness will be left mostly or fully intact. The patient will never miss out on the joy of certain acidic food because he or she will never have known sourness to begin with. Studies have even concluded that the three remaining tastes may even be stronger and more enjoyable as a result of the permanent loss of the sourness taste buds. It is estimated that if more than 65% of the population agrees to this elective procedure on all of their newborns, then mononucleosis could be completely eradicated within 25 years, and rates of the infectious disease could drastically diminish within as few as 15 years. It is also noted that the procedure may have the added benefit of reducing the onset of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and throat cancer. The health administration will be closely monitoring these and other possible benefits over the course of the next five years to determine whether or not to make the procedure compulsory for all hospital births. Since the cost of the procedure may be prohibitive for certain families, several government programs are being created to subsidize the cost. In most cases, the procedure will be available free of cost to those patients coming from low-income households.

How did I come up with this imaginative and whimsical idea? I purposely chose the back of the tongue because it was gentle, almost benign...almost. When the reader takes a small step back and ponders for a few moments what life might be like without the unique sensation that comes from drinking lemonade on a hot day, or the pleasant tartness unique to a dessert such as apple pie, they start to see the inherent unfairness of such a scenario. It shifts from being a concern of health, to a concern of a whole and satisfactory eating experience. Like sex, eating is one of life's greatest pleasures. I would be livid if I knew that a pleasant sensation had been robbed from me against my will all for the sake of a supposed health benefit that may or may not actually be of any use to me. I have never contracted mononucleosis, and though I know it's a terrible disease, I would never relinquish any part of the culinary experience to prevent a possible infection. We would never think to cheat our children out of the joy of lemonade on a summer afternoon, the refreshing zing of a grapefruit, or the zest of a raspberry vinaigrette over cold crisp romaine lettuce. These are little things that make life worth living. A fully sensory sexual experience is a big thing that makes life worth living. A lot of educated people in America aren't making this connection. I'm here to help.</td></tr><tr><td>89</td><td>Tara Chapman</td><td>Dec 4, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0089'>Permalink</a></td><td>Every major medical organization in the world has deemed routine infant circumcision as a cosmetic procedure, not a therapeutic procedure.

Americans should be setting the standard for fair and educated treatment of all human beings. It is abhorrent to me that a US government agency is not standing against such a horrific act of child abuse let alone actively supporting it.

The barbaric practice of genital mutilation of both females and males has no place in modern society. The medical findings in this report are dubious at best and lean heavily towards bias of the conducting group. There is no clinical evidence to show that the same reduction in both HIV and STI transmission could be achieved through education of both sexual methods and basic human hygiene rather than physical removing part of a boys penis without the individual being of age to object. I challenge the doctors in this study to produce an adult that would volunteer for the procedure based on the studies evidence.

This practice served people in history for medical purposes where clean water, effective communication and education were unavailable. In some places the only communication that was able to be made was via religion thus this became religious doctrine that remains in some religions today however just like female genital mutilation any civilized country and secular government should oppose and actively work to abolish this practice.

This practice has been very common in the USA historically, however a widening scope of educated new parents are choosing to not harm their baby boys by subjecting them to a process that has been normalized over time, much like other historical practices were before we became more educated such as lobotomy or the use of leaches.

Unfortunately due to sensitive nature of this issue we are also fighting a battle against male ego. In America there are many men that feel that if it wasn't a problem for them it shouldn't be for their son's. This largely has psychological roots in these men not wishing to deal with the fact that their parents unknowingly abused them in this way, although these parent should not be blamed.

If the CDC continues with this line of recommendation it is not only helping to subject another generation of boys and the men they grow into, to this physical and mental anguish it is also actively and immediately condoning the organized physical abuse of children. Anyone working for and acting on behave of the CDC in this matter should be working to revoke this as soon as humanly possible.

In addition to my previous challenge I also challenge the CDC to publish the names of all clinical people involved in this study along with information about there current circumcision status - both male and female. In the light of the well documented psychological bias that is mentioned above this information is crucial to the validity of this study as it directly impact group identity bias.

In the rare instance that this occurs girls are given an antibiotic or some other non-invasive form of medical care. This excuse to perform circumcision is unnecessarily invasive compared to alternative methods of treatment. Again, does first, do no harm not apply to this situation!?

Who's body is it anyways? Shouldnt the owner of the penis be able to decide what happens to it? There are thousands of individuals across North America who attest to feeling violated, betrayed, mutilated, and unhappy with the fact that their genitals were modified without their consent. Parents should not get to have this say. I feel that in many instances fathers who have been circumcised feel the necessity to justify their procedures. They chose to circumcise their male children based on the thought pattern that 'that's just what you do' or justifying it in some personal way. Mothers leave this decision up to their husbands because "They have the penis" but no scientific research goes into the reasoning behind it. I think it is simple, his body, his choice. If I was born a male I would be furious that this choice was taken for me. No consent, no emergency, no surgery!

38 leading non-US physicians disagree with the American Academy of Pediatrics as stated in the " Cultural Bias in the AAP's 2012 Technical Report and Policy Statement on Male Circumcision" which can easily be found on the internet Many countries do not routinely circumcise their infant boys and they have seen little to no complications with leaving boys intact. Those countries respect and accept the natural male form. They have determined that only one in Many countries feel the practice of RIC is barbaric, outdated, and completely unnecessary.

All mammals are born with foreskin both male and female. That evolution's way of telling us its beneficial and healthy to have foreskin!

The risks and complications of this surgery are grossly underestimated & under recorded. No scientific body has researched extensively the effect of circumcision on mental health, sexual relations for men AND their partners? Foreskin has many functions which can not be discounted! My partner suffers damage including mangled frenulum, skin bridges, holes in his urethral opening, skin tags, keratinization of his glans, loss of sensitivity to the penis and he has had to endure corrective surgeries to repair the damage done by his circumcision. The huge need for corrective surgeries minor or major should be considered before recommending circumcision as a prophylactic! Babies die from this procedure, have reactions to the anesthetic, ect yet none of these are considered seriously which is repulsive and unacceptable.
Phimosis is wrongly diagnosed as a reason to circumcise even though retraction is not supposed to happen until puberty, hypocritical much doctors recommend it causing further damage.

The USA has the highest rate of circumcision and also one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS? Isn't that counter intuitive to the supposed research that has been done in those so very obviously biased studies. The USA also has one of the highest consumption rates of sexual stimulants and yet no one has bothered to correlate this towards circumcision. Shame!

Studies in Africa. These are poor second and third world countries we are using as guinea pigs in order to justify a religious practice in our own back yard. We could be offering them real aid and medical resources but instead we are convincing a very uneducated people to line themselves and their children up to have their genitals cut as some sort of a miracle breakthrough for preventing HIV and AIDS. This is one of the most despicable and unethical types of research that I have witnessed and should be widely condemned by medical science.</td></tr><tr><td>97</td><td>Craig Chapman</td><td>Dec 4, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0097'>Permalink</a></td><td>Female circumcision is outlawed.

Why is it that recommendations are being made to circumcise American infant boys based on studies done on African adult males? How can you compare the two?

Is it true that the only reason the intact males in the African study had a higher incidence of std's is because the circumcised males had to wait 6 weeks before having sex while the intact males did not?

Isn't it a fact that it is difficult for a male to get a uti in the first place because of the length of the penis that the bacteria has to travel up to reach the bladder. Which usually gets washed out when the male urinates. CDC20140012

If it is so much better, then why is most of the world uncircumcised and healthy? If it were truly better, why has only America decided to say it's cleaner? It's a natural body part. If they were born with it, how can it be that bad? What's next?

What is it about American boys and men that makes them so much more prone to these penile infections, cancers, defects and such? There is obviously a larger, dangerous issue here if the rest of the world (barring Africa...coincidentally where the CDCs studies were conducted) is populated with healthy intact males? In a country that has one of the highest rates of infant circumcision, we should also have the lowest rate of HIV and STD infection. However, we are (again...ironically barring Africa...) one of the most HIV and STD infected countries. What is it that is special and different about America makes our boys and men among the only ones in the world who are routinely circumcised as infants due to all these benefits, yet the vast majority (again...we must exclude Africa here) of the world does just fine without it?

I think I may know the answer.

It's because doctors here stand to make a damn pretty penny off the procedure. And not just when they perform it. They get paid at that point by the parents or an insurance company; sometimes both! Then, they can give the foreskin to a cosmetic company, make a bit more. For the many boys who have immediate complications, there is the payment for the aftercare and subsequent procedures. The ones that don't have problems until they are sexually active will become money makers for doctors and pharmaceutical companies and sexual aide companies. It's only the boys who remain intact, or the ones that die due to complications from circumcision, that do not guarantee extra money for doctors and other entities. The doctors still try to get the intact boys under the knife though, by providing harmful and incorrect intact care information to parents.

I have a few concerns related to your decision to back up Routine Infant Circumcision (RIC). If one of the biggest reasons for RIC to be done is that it lowers the chances of men catching HIV, why are you not advocating the use of condoms instead of a surgical procedure? Do condoms not work for intact males as it does for cut males? If a condom works the same for both cut and intact males why should a male be circumcised if it's the same as wearing a condom that does not harm the male? Do these risks really out way the chance of a person loosing their newborn child's life, as 100s of newborn males do due to "complications" from RIC? Why does the CDC state that it prevents penile cancer when the American Cancer Society clearly states that RIC does not prevent penile cancer? Why is it that you're using an African based study that was done on adult men as your resource of credit yet there is an over 10 year long study done by Dr. Dreher in Jamaica that clearly states the use of marijuana during pregnancy and throughout breastfeeding does not harm the newborn yet you do not back up this study. Nor does the CDC condone the hundreds of studies down that show that the use of marijuana can cure all forms of cancers, epilepsy, fibromyalgia, etc? The CDC clearly states that marijuana is dangerous and should never be used, yet it's never killed a person and has cured hundreds of people. But you will condone RIC, a procedure that kills 100s of babies every year based off of an African study done on adult males? Does the CDC acknowledge that other countries do not perform RIC and that it's even banned in some countries? If the CDC does, then why is countries like Britains people not dying off from HIV, penile cancer, or having issues with UTIs? Also, females are more likely to develop UTIs, and vaginas are much harder to keep cleaner than an intact male so why is the CDC not backing up Female Circumcision? Especially considering the study you're using is from Africa, where female circumcision (also known as female genital mutilation) is commonly preformed? If you, the CDC could answer these questions with legitimate statistics, sources, and studies I would appreciate it very much.
CDC-2014-0012

This makes me so sad. The rate of circumcision has dropped so much in the US that now the CDC is trying to push for health insurance companies to cover the procedure... Only proving that they are only concerned with making money. And you know what helps prevent the spread of HIV and other STD's??? Condoms. That's really over-reaching for a "medical" reason for circumcision. I'd rather teach my boys to practice safe sex than to have a functional body part surgically removed from their innocent, perfect bodies without them being able to consent to the permanent alteration.

Were both control groups utilized in the studies regarding HIV given the same access to condoms?
Did both control groups have a comprehensive STI/HIV transmission education class prior to the study?
How did the malaria status of the control groups factor into the results of the study?

Why is it that now, after so many years of not recommending it, do you suddenly change your stance? Could it be because more babies are being born and left intact, they way should be? As a result, you're not getting that big paycheck from mutilating newborn boys? Oh, I'm sorry, I meant circumcising.

The are absolutely ZERO benefits of circumcision. If infection is your concern, then put out information to properly care for an intact infant penis. The few who get infections, are most likely from the mothers who were not correctly informed on how to care for an intact penis properly. It's really simple... When intact... DO NOT RETRACT. The intact infant penis is designed to keep bacteria out, and therefore keeping infections out. Retracting is extremely painful, and introduces infection.

Furthermore, if you're going to recommend routine infant circumcision, you should legalize female circumcision as well.... Why are infant males different than infant females? Are they not perfect in your eyes?

Lastly, when conducting an experiment on the circumcised penis, versus intact, and risk of infection, the least you could do is preform it on AMERICAN MEN.

CDC-2014-0012: How do you justify the removal of healthy tissue on non-consenting minors? Routine circumcision is a blatant disregard of medical ethics, and no other country recommends it. In the US, infant circumcision is a huge cash cow. Do you feel that promoting cosmetic surgery on minors is a conflict of interest

Why is it considered a birth defect to be born without foreskin?
Are there any studies currently being performed to analyze the functions of the male foreskin?

Until a unified study is completed, validated, and published, it is beyond irresponsible for an institution as publicly "worshipped" as the CDC to condone a cosmetic surgery performed on neonates who cannot and do not offer informed consent while at the same time not enforcing a strict "informed consent" policy for parents. Why does the WHO still debate these results? Why is there so much noise in the medical community about performing a well-done study. Many professionals would like the opportunity to complete such a study. Why does the CDC not simply state the truth: right now, we do NOT have enough validated evidence to support a position either way.

The CDC should NOT be a "follow the bureaucratic, follow the money" group. Our countries public welfare depends upon the CDC giving good, viable, studied, and accurate information. These three "studies" (using the term loosely, here) are certainly NOT any of those things.

Furthermore, let's take a real look at HIV/AIDS and STI's in general. The HUGE boom in the 90's of STI's occurred in a predominately circumcised population in our country. Many of the men who have dies and will die from HIV/AIDS were, in fact, already cut. Many of the women who received the virus from their sexual partners were sexually active with circumcised males.

And where is the stance on FGM? The fact is, there is more published evidence on the benefits of female circumcision than there are male circ's. But we don't do that. We need to ask societally why....why do we value our sons less than our daughters. Why do we think it acceptable to take away sexual function for a maybe? Why would we promote the cutting of genitals over the use of condoms? Why would we use a group of studies that has been and will continue to repudiated by the medical community across the globe? Why is the CDC taking this stance without the verifiable and accurate information that they require for vaccines, disease control, etc.

The CDC has to recognize the implications of this published stance. It will ensure the following:

1. The HIV/AIDS and STI rates will SOAR. Condoms will be out, circumcised penis in. The only reliable way to reduce infections has been and will remain condom use. If you think that won't happen, just remember our recent increases in active cases (in predominately circumcised males) since the great "Condom Campaign" of the 80's and 90's stalled.
2. Parents are woefully under-informed about this issue. This proclamation will ensure that they stay that way.
3. Your credibility (along with the AAP's) is already questionable.....this rash and medically repugnant decision will ensure you remain untrustworthy.
4. Europe. They still don't buy the circumcision myths. They still keep their neonates whole (predominately). Why are they not experiencing sharp increases in STI's? This needs to be answered.
5. Circumcision HURTS. This stance will ensure more little boys suffer this great pain (that often has lifelong consequence, think the sharp spike in ED and the drugs used to treat it) for still, no reason scientifically applicable to our country.

from the 1984 AAP report, and still valid:
The Function of the Foreskin: The glans at birth is delicate and easily irritated by urine and feces. The foreskin shields the glans; with circumcision this protection is lost. In such cases, the glans and especially the urinary opening (meatus) may become irritated or infected, causing ulcers, meatitis (inflammation of the meatus), and meatal stenosis (a narrowing of the urinary opening). Such problems virtually never occur in uncircumcised penises. The foreskin protects the glans throughout life.

Circumcision has many risks, side effects, and changes the quality of sex. Circumcised men have more difficulties reaching orgasm, and their female partners experience more vaginal pains and an inferior sex life, a new study shows.

Every year, many babies die, or need follow-up visits and surgeries to fix botched circumcisions. With no other body part physicians recommend prophylactic surgery to a healthy (and non-consenting) child. "First, do no harm."

A small study from Turkey on voluntary adult circumcisions (for religious reasons) showed an increase in ejaculation time after circumcision (reasons being sensitivity), but in their circumcision culture, their conclusions were that "The increase in the ejaculatory latency time can be considered an advantage rather than a complication." LOLwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14751371

A newer study from 2007 on adult circumcision showed that there was no significant difference in the ejaculation latency time, but also stated the following: "Masturbatory pleasure decreased after circumcision in 48% of the respondents, while 8% reported increased pleasure. Masturbatory difficulty increased after circumcision in 63% of the respondents but was easier in 37%. About 6% answered that their sex lives improved, while 20% reported a worse sex life after circumcision.

There was a decrease in masturbatory pleasure and sexual enjoyment after circumcision, indicating that adult circumcision adversely affects sexual function in many men, possibly because of complications of the surgery and a loss of nerve endings." www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17155977

The was also a monofilament test done on circumcised and intact males which concluded the following: "The glans of the circumcised penis is less sensitive to fine touch than the glans of the uncircumcised penis. The transitional region from the external to the internal prepuce is the most sensitive region of the uncircumcised penis and more sensitive than the most sensitive region of the circumcised penis. Circumcision ablates the most sensitive parts of the penis."

There is also some preliminary evidence that circumcised men are more likely to suffer from alexithymia and erectile dysfunction: "The circumcised men had age-adjusted alexithymia scores 19.9 percent higher than the intact men; were 1.57 times more likely to have high alexithymia scores; were 2.30 times less likely to have low alexithymia scores; had higher prevalence of two of the three alex-ithymia factors (difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings); and were 4.53 times more likely to use an erectile dysfunction drug.

While there is some evidence to support the fact that circumcision has reduced incidence of heterosexual HIV transmission in some parts of Africa, no research exists taking into account modern Western hygiene and healthcare as exists in the United States and Europe. The simple fact is that complications from circumcision itself, though often classified as 'minor,' are far more common than complications from being intact.

Secondly, the penis is a very sensitive, delicate organ, and the foreskin is in place for a reason. Removal of it for preventive purposes has other consequences, not limited to the risk of complications. Reduced sensitivity and cosmetic defects are very common and very possible.

The simple fact is that circumcision probably has some minor role in reducing HIV transmission in societies which lack modern hygiene and medical practices, such as regular washing and high rates of condom usage. Ultimately, focusing on encouraging the use of condoms and unsafe sex in general would be of vastly more benefit than encouraging the amputation of a part of the body of every boy born in the United States, and of adults who did not go through the procedure at birth. One need only look at the rest of the world, and the entire world throughout history, to see that circumcision is far from an important procedure.</td></tr><tr><td>120</td><td>Gary Harryman</td><td>Dec 4, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0120'>Permalink</a></td><td>The CDC can only get away with this insanity because, most Americans think that "circumcision" is "Just a little snip-no big deal". Nobody, not even those admirable souls who demonstrate against it in all kinds of weather, will call this insanity what it is - the forced physical mutilation of infant boys that leaves the victims sexually sub-normal for life and is a violation of fundamental human rights on a scale that is a crime against humanity. The fact that nobody talks about the Ridged Band is proof that this decision was a political one that has nothing to do with protecting children from disease or harm.

Human Genital Anatomy #101: Neurologically, the four most specialized pressure-sensitive cells in the human body are Meissners corpuscles for localized light touch and fast touch, Merkels disc cells for light pressure and tactile form and texture, Ruffinis corpuscles for slow sustained pressure, deep skin tension, stretch, flutter and slip, and Pacinian corpuscles for deep touch and detection of rapid external vibrations. They are found only in the tongue, lips, palms, fingertips, nipples, and the clitoris, and in the crests of the Ridged Band at the tip of the male foreskin. These four specialized cell types process tens of thousands of information impulses per second and can sense texture, stretch, vibration, and movement at the micrometre level. These are the cells that allow blind people to "see" Braille with their fingertips. Cut them off and, male or female, it's like trying to read Braille with your elbow as a veritable symphony of sensation is downgraded dramatically and the victim is sub-normalized for life. A woman can live without the sensitivity of the visible part of her clitoris, and a man can live without the mobile and most sensitive part of his penis, the Ridged Band, but both are better off with their natural fine-touch parts intact - and so are their sexual partners. Genital mutilations, male or female, are religious and/or medical frauds and cannot be tolerated in a civilized world. Google The Ridged Band and The Lost List for more information.

The bureaucrat who approved this boondoggle at the CDC should be tried in The Hague for Crimes Against Humanity.

HIV and other STIs are prevented with safe sex practices such as wearing condoms, not by removing the most erogenous tissue from the penis.

Every newborn that suffers circumcision is left with raised cortisol levels and a hindrance to their psychological development and ability to bond with caretakers.
Consult with the health organizations of nations that do not routinely circumcise children, such as the United Kingdom and other European countries, and learn why some go so far as to discourage it for all but the most serious medical cases.

One passage of the supplementary information I find particularly egregious is the following: "Such decision making [regarding circumcision] is made in the context of not only health considerations, but also other social, cultural, ethical, and religious factors."

This is exactly why United States physicians should not be performing unnecessary surgery on infant males who have no connected health issues. The foundation of our circumcision tradition is the sex-phobic culture of the 19th century and the subsequent argument that a child should look like his father. Attempts to use studies that focus on very specific circumstances where HIV is prevalent to justify a cultural norm is completely inappropriate in the scientific community.

Like many other parts of our bodies, the foreskin is an essential, natural human trait that should be celebrated. The conversation regarding circumcision in the United States often focuses on the idea of "benefits" as though the removal of this body part has no negative impacts on a person's wellbeing and self image. Studies focusing on HIV prevention seem to ignore a huge part of the developed world that doesn't circumcise their children and actually has significantly lower rates of HIV and other STDs occurring among their men.

As a gay adult male who is uncircumcised, I have met so many men who wish they could reverse the procedure that was performed on them at infancy, and it's heartbreaking to know they had no say in the matter. There is always a strong chance that a child will regret their involuntary circumcision, and they can never get back that innervated tissue. And yet, if an adult male is regretful that his penis was left intact, he can always have the procedure done as an adult. Please consider the bigger picture and your moral obligation not to harm patients without reason.

In case you are not familiar, allow me to provide you with a list of just a few of the innumerable health issues and general annoyances that woman with intact genitalia face:

Yeast infections
Urinary tract infections
Vulvodynia
Vulvar varicosities
Vulvar cancer
Genital lesions
Labial cysts
Clitoral phimosis
Clitoral infection
Various sexually transmitted diseases
Sebaceous cysts (ingrown hairs)
Persistent vaginal odor
Smegma accumulation
Menstrual odor
Skin sensitivity (redness and irritation)

Several of these conditions are either inevitable or extremely common and occur as early as infancy. Some continue to increase in severity or frequency as the female body ages. Some are more rare but certainly not unheard of. A few can even lead to death. In short, the female genitals are a virtual land mine of potential health complications.

Across our lifetimes, we women spend millions of dollars on antibiotics, anti-fungal creams and suppositories, lubricants, douches, freshening sprays, odor absorbing pantiliners, special soaps, flushable wipes, and cranberry supplements. Our insurance is required to cover our many visits to the gynecologist to address these "maladies" as well as the medications required in order to treat them.

Despite all of this, we women manage quite well. We manage to keep ourselves clean, to seek appropriate medical care and treatment when issues arise, and to find partners who consider our bodies sexually desirable. We do not have to worry if a lover prefers his or her women to be "cut" or "uncut".

But most importantly, DESPITE ALL OF THIS, our genitals, our occasionally problematic but perfectly normal genitals, are considered valuable enough to be protected by federal law from any form of surgical alteration, including the tiniest of nicks often used in one of the most common forms of female circumcision (sunat, which was legal in the US until 1997).

As an American woman, my genitals are respected as my own and my parents were never counseled on whether or not they should be altered. My sexual organs are not subject to the religious, cultural, or cosmetic preferences of my family or physician. They are not disregarded as "extra skin" nor were they vulnerable to non-consented, prophylactic removal at birth.

So please tell me then, CDC- why is my beautiful baby boy not deserving of this same protection? Why do you not consider his perfectly healthy, functional body to be worth keeping intact? Why are you advocating that part of his sexual organ be painfully removed and disposed of shortly after birth in the event that it may, someday, develop some sort of medical complication? Do other body parts not have the same potential for concern? And yet, you would never think to remove them as a preventative measure.

Please, I ask you to reexamine your stance on routine infant and child circumcision. You have the opportunity to be a champion for the human rights of American males. Please do not miss out on that opportunity. Boys, and the men they will become, deserve to have their bodies protected, respected, and kept whole.</td></tr><tr><td>126</td><td>james blair</td><td>Dec 4, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0126'>Permalink</a></td><td>Telling people the lie that it's "beneficial" to destroy a natural part of the body on the small chance that they won't get an STD or AIDs is totally bogus and FUD at it's finest.

But I strongly encourage the CDC to avoid making any recommendation that would appear to encourage parents to circumcise their infants. Supposing that the risk of HIV transmission for circumcised males is indeed lower than for uncircumcised males, my question is the following: if I were entering a sexual relationship with an HIV-positive person, would the CDC's advice to me differ depending on whether or not I am circumcised? If, *irrespective of circumcision*, I am advised to use a condom and perhaps Truvada, then we know something about the importance of circumcision in HIV prevention.

My plea is that CDC take seriously the importance of autonomy, consent, and bodily integrity. We should be skeptical of a medical procedure that irrevocably modifies the anatomy of a newborn infant, incapable of giving consent. The medical justification should be really convincing. A hypothesized reduction in HIV transmission probability -- if the reduction does not even change medical advice concerning HIV prevention strategies (condoms, Truvada), then I submit that the justification is lacking.

One final point: when an infant is born, neither parent nor pediatrician knows whether he will ever engage in high-risk behavior. A great many men never do. HIV prevention as a medical justification for infant circumcision is further weakened by the fact that the benefit will only accrue to that fraction of circumcised babies who later engage in high-risk behavior. It seems like there could be compelling evidence supporting a CDC recommendation of adult circumcision in some cases, but the justification for recommending infant circumcision remains woefully lacking.</td></tr><tr><td>137</td><td>Anonymous Anonymous</td><td>Dec 4, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0137'>Permalink</a></td><td>The CDC conveniently overlooks the European medical community's recent denunciation of American circumcision policy (link below).

The public and many medical professionals will not take the time to truly understand what the findings mean. Some concerns include:

-The study does not take into account the many psychological / emotional /physical issues associated with circumcision. There is a network of support groups across the USA and Canada (for example the NORM group) that assist adult men going through these issues. Many thousands of men have also chosen to undergo "foreskin restoration" techniques because of these psychological and physical issues. While these issues may not be as damaging as HIV, they have a very real impact on men, their wives and partners and families. Here is one source that summarizes these impacts (Doctors Opposing Circumcision): http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/DOC/statement06.html

-The guidelines state that circumcision has little or no effect on sexual satisfaction or function. However there is clear evidence (as stated above) that this is not true for a significant number of men.

-The study does not find that circumcision has a clear benefit for reducing transmission of HIV during anal sex, yet also states that most new HIV cases in the USA are from homosexual intercourse. Further, the guidelines suggest that only "sub-populations are likely to benefit". Therefore the true quantitative benefit to men in the USA in reducing HIV transmission is very unclear and very difficult to quantify. It seems that it "might" help some subpopulations in the US.

-The study is based on clinical trials in Africa where HIV rates are much higher and cultural, sexual practices and psychological factors are significantly different. Therefore I submit that extrapolating this study to a US population is erroneous.

In summary, while there is some evidence that circumcision may reduce HIV transmission rates in certain subpopulations in Africa, the guidelines ignore many other negative factors associate with male circumcision. The biggest problem is that most circumcision occurs among male infants who do not give consent. The key recommendation of the study should be that American heterosexual adults (who can make informed consent) may wish to consider circumcision to reduce their chances of HIV infection (and only if they have unprotected sex with multiple partners).</td></tr><tr><td>146</td><td>Anonymous Anonymous</td><td>Dec 4, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0146'>Permalink</a></td><td>I am appalled that the government shows so little concern with baby boys' right to bodily autonomy. The unnecessary removal of a baby girl's labia isn't even questioned: it is simply immoral, and that is the end of the story. Yet you go to such extreme lengths to defend the removal of boys' erogenous tissue without ever considering their pain.

If adults wish to get circumcised, that is their business. However, the vague idea that a boy may someday contract an STD is no excuse to cut off a part of his penis as an infant, any more than it would excuse cutting off part of a girl's vulva. As an adult, he may decide to get circumcised in full awareness of the risks and possible benefits; he may practice safe sex, which is far more effective than circumcision in reducing the spread of STDs; he may even be celibate.

But if he is circumcised as an infant, he will not be making an informed decision; rather, an almost certainly UNinformed decision will be thrust upon him; he will experience severe pain, both during the cutting-off of part of his genitals and after as his penis heals and his highly-sensitive glans is exposed rather than protected; he may suffer any number of complications, some of which would make sexual activity extremely painful and will require further surgery to fix, if they can be fixed at all; and, as is the case with all surgery, he may even die. He could die because his parents and doctor decided cutting off part of his penis was more sensible than teaching him about safe sex.</td></tr><tr><td>147</td><td>Beth Doyle</td><td>Dec 4, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0147'>Permalink</a></td><td>We live in a completely industrialized world where our citizens have access to health care and education. Your recommendations regarding circumcision are misleading. The recommendations should clearly outline that for SOME populations the benefits outweigh the risks. Not for all populations. For instance, the risk of male UTI in infants and boys is already relatively low, and without other risk factors (vesicioureteral reflux), you are essentially telling people that reducing the (already small) risk of UTIs outweighs the risks of the circumcision procedure and possible long term affects of the procedure. The risk of reducing STD transmission, again, is less of a benefit here in the US where people have access to condoms, and sex education. It makes sense for populations with high rates of HIV (some African populations), particularly where there is no access to condoms and/or sex education. Please consider revising your recommendations in a way that makes sense for our population. Why is it that the UK has only a fraction of the number of males receiving circumcision than we do in the US, and yet they don't have rampant STD problems? The same goes for Australia and the majority of Europe.

Most of the men on this earth are intact and healthy. I cannot believe the CDC would consider taking into account some faulty African studies and apply it to newborn boys in this country. We live in the 21st Century not in Victorian times. Evolve, its what humans do! And men still have their foreskins, because its a functional body part!

Gentlemen of the CDC look around you, look outside the USA, look to Europe, South America, Asia, anywhere in the world and you'll see millions of healthy intact men and boy. They are not all dying from STDs and penile cancer. There are condoms for STDs prevention and antibiotics for UTIs, there is no need to mutilate newborn males bodies.

The majority of sexually active, adult males in the USA are circumcised, yet our HIV and STI rates are among the highest in the developed world. The stated risks according to the CDC for routine infant circumcision are on the order of over 100 deaths per year. If we quantify this, the risk of dying due to complications from circumcision surgery are far greater than the risk of ever "needing" to be circumcised later in life. Amputation should always be a last resort. How about recommending the use of condoms to prevent infection and antibiotics to treat UTIs, as well as providing caregivers with the information to properly care for intact children (instead of forcefully retracting, which introduces microtears and bacteria)? Where do I even begin to comment on the ethics behind forced infant circumcision on a healthy child?

It is extremely important to realize that many of the risks/outcomes of circumcision are more long term in nature and may not start to become apparent until months or years after the procedure is performed. Is this statement/recommendation taking that into account? Things like meatal stenosis, painful erection, erectile dysfunction, excessive scar tissue, etc, are things that take time to develop after the procedure, and if you take them into account may amount to significantly higher "risk" in the procedure when compared to the benefits (and most of the benefits are things that can be accomplished by other means, primarily good hygeine and safe sex practices).

I'm not sure the public, and new parents in particular, are getting the full picture of the risks and LONG TERM outcomes of this procedure when they discuss it with their physicians and pediatricians. When we talked about it, "risks" from their point of view were limited to immediate risks of the surgery (and note, they also did not discuss things like problems with breastfeeding, etc, that are frequently noted in newly circumcised boys, but only 'physical' issues like bleeding).

I rely on the CDC to give accurate information and to be science minded, and frequently refer to you for information and statistics on infectious diseases and vaccinations. However I can't wrap my head around this being good policy to promote - it doesn't seem to take into account long term problems with the procedure, and also seems to rely on studies performed in a completely different environment than the United States as far as any protective benefit in regards to STIs.

I also feel that it's very important for the CDC (and AAP, and medical community in general) to start considering that this particular body part has a purpose, and an important one. For a long time it was considered "extraneous" and unnecessary, driving the idea that circumcision is not a big deal. But when considering the basic anatomy, it seems pretty clear that it serves several important purposes, and it's about time the medical community in the US began considering that to be important.

Given the source of the STI studies, the environment and cultural situations that influenced them, the lack of consideration for LONG term effects of circumcision rather than just immediate ones, and the general lack of consideration for the benefits of having an intact body, I am left feeling like the CDC may be acting in the interest of a medical community that makes a decent amount of money on this procedure, rather than in the best interests of boys and men and their health. I think it's very important to note that in countries where the vast majority of men are intact (western europe, canada), the rates of HIV seem to be lower than in the US, where at this point the majority of adult men are circumcised.

I also think that there should be new research on UTI rates in children under 1 year, for years circumcision was sold as a means of protecting against these, but also for years parents were given incorrect information on care and cleaning, and I believe statistics about UTIs may be skewed as a result. As this is sold as a "benefit" to parents, it is extremely important to get better data, and find out if the rates of UTI are actually greater in intact children when they are given *correct* care and not retracted.</td></tr><tr><td>154</td><td>Private Citizen</td><td>Dec 4, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0154'>Permalink</a></td><td>It is completely inappropriate for doctors, governments or other groups to take a proactive stance on any issue which would encourage the unnecessary mutilation of a human being. While medical evidence may show that circumcision reduces the transfer of any STD, it does not mean that such an extreme recommendation should be encouraged. Parents, governments and medical professionals should respect the right of the individual to make such a personal and private decision without coercion, fear or force.

When we as a society cannot allow or accept that a person has a choice over his or her own body, we weaken the fabric of our entire society. Where will such steps end? Will we next force women to have parts of their body removed because it might lead to a reduction in STDs? Can we not simply instruct uncircumcised males in hygiene that will lead to the same result? Is our society so blinded by the quick-fix and the profit margin that it will mutilate a completely normal person? How can we even consider encouraging a person to such harm when a little education and improved hygiene is all that is required?

Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misandry) defines misandry in this way," Misandry /msndri/, from the Greek misos (, "hatred") and anr, andros (, gen. ; "man"), is the hatred or dislike of men or boys.[1][2] Misandry can be manifested in numerous ways, including sexual discrimination, denigration of men, violence against men, and sexual objectification of men. The form "misandrist" was first used in 1871." The recommendation to mutilate the penis of every male objectifies men as a group and clearly is an extremely violent projection against men as a whole. Such a recommendation is morally wrong and stigmatizes every uncircumcised male.

I hope that you will return to the boundary of human decency and make a clear recommendation that encouraging circumcision is wrong and that individuals have the right to remain in their natural uncircumcised state. As a health organization you should focus your attention on hygiene and other approaches that do not encourage the mutilation of the human body. Neither men nor women should feel compelled to mutilate their bodies. We should encourage the development of virtue among our men and women and we should use reason to help them make the right decision.

I realize that as our population grows that we are constantly moving toward a quick fix with a knife or money. This is not the best approach to our problems. We must find a better course in dealing with our problems. A course that helps us live together and does not persecute a person who chooses to remain as DNA dictates him or her to be.</td></tr><tr><td>155</td><td>Raymond Holden</td><td>Dec 4, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0155'>Permalink</a></td><td>I think that even if the cdc suggests circumcision, this should only be a choice to be made in medical emergencies or by the boy himself when he turns 18.

I am a pediatric resident in California. I practice in an area where circumcision rates are low. I am not required to perform circumcisions nor am I trained adequately manage the complications. This topic is of intense debate among residents and attending physicians alike. The proposed statement may effect more harm than benefit in medical practice, particularly in areas of already low circumcision rates. Allow me to reflect on a couple personal anecdotes, followed by evidence.

I have had a handful of teenagers who ask me confidentially about the health benefits of circumcision. And although I present the evidence, I always emphasize the need for and importance of condoms. Their take-away point is, "If I need to use a condom anyway, why have a painful procedure done on my body?" In the area where I practice, sexual education in public schools has been drastically reduced such that it only takes place once in middle school. Evidence is consistent that comprehensive sexual education and counseling on safe sex practices will have a greater impact.

As for parents who are not even considering circumcision, to raise this topic is almost a cultural affront. They ask, "Why are advocating for removing a normal part of the body, when there is nothing wrong with it?" They see it as inflicting a painful procedure on the body when it is not medically necessary or indicated. This can foster distrust in the medical system, particularly in an area of poverty and already poor access to health care.

The reported complication rate of circumcision is low if done before 1 year of age, and it sounds benign until you personally witness a serious complication. I observed an operation by a urologist who had to graft skin from the patient's abdomen to his penis because too much skin was removed in a circumcision. When I walk by the operating rooms, I always see at least 2-3 circumcision revisions/corrections scheduled. Perhaps this is sampling bias, but 0.5% does not seem to adequately reflect reality.

If the proposed CDC recommendations are taken at face value, medical providers will be unprepared to adequately counsel patients in the context of their patient populations. The reported 50-60% reduction in contracting HIV in the African studies are relative risk reductions, not absolute risk reductions. On a population scale, relative risk reduction makes sense but for an individual, that impact may be negligible. And if a patient were to ask whether the African studies have been replicated or validated in the US, how are we to answer when there is no such data? How can we be sure that those studies are externally valid? Sexual practices and primary modes of HIV transmission differ greatly between the US and sub-Saharan Africa, are the recommendations not premature without a study confirming this risk reduction in a US population?

We are pressed for time to see our patients as it currently stands. Will I devote the same amount of time to discussing the benefits/risks of circumcision when the teenager has never had foreskin/urologic pathology, inconsistently uses condoms, and does not desire the procedure? Or will I devote that time to promoting correct and consistent condom use, and safe sex and healthy relationship advice? Which will make a greater individual AND public health impact?

In summary, on a provider level, devoting time towards counseling patients on male circumcision will take time away from counseling that has a greater impact on individual and public health. Additionally, the recommendations must be taken into the cultural and geographic context of a provider's patient population, but many providers are not equipped to do so. And to counsel on circumcision to an uncircumcised patient who is not considering the procedure may be viewed as a personal affront or demonization of a normal healthy body part, which can further cultural stigmas.

Finally, consider a quote from Nietsche: "There are no facts, only interpretation." When Canada, Europe, and Australia look at the same information but reach a polar opposite conclusion, we must take pause.

But first we need to have a serious discussion about autonomy, and inherent agency over one's own body. In other words, any recommendations must be for ADULT circumcision only, otherwise it is a violation of human rights. The removal of sexual tissue is not an insignificant thing!

Circumcision, the removal of erogenous tissue from the penis, should be a personal choice. The individual must decide weather its worthwhile to marginally reduce their chances of STI by removing their own sexual tissue.
Personally, I am so glad that my father is a European immigrant and refused to have me circumcised, and there are plenty of men out there who are glad they are intact. I also know many circumcised men who wish they hadn't been (though of course, most don't think about it.)

If i woke up from a surgery on one part of my body and found that the surgeon had removed my foreskin, because my parent requested it, I would sue, I would win, and I would STILL be angry, because a part of my body (with nerves) has been permanently removed. Just because it happens to a baby who is UNABLE to object, doesn't make it permissible.

It should always, unless medically necessary, be up to the individual if they want to remove a part of their body.

To the vacillating mothers reading this, and to the fathers who were cut as babies and don't see the issue as significant:
well, it might be significant to your son.

I have been deeply disturbed to hear reports that circumcision is being promoted as a means to prevent HIV/AIDS both in the United States, and in high-risk areas globally such as sub-saharan Africa. As the CDC should well know, the data supporting risk reduction for STIs thanks to circumcision is largely inconclusive and lacked controls to distinguish between correlation versus causation. What is more, the risk reduction it suggests is extremely small. Most importantly, even if there is a (minute) risk reduction, a person who is circumcised can still very easily contract and pass on HIV. Circumcision does not mitigate the need to engage in safe sexual practices as a means to prevent HIV, nor does it alleviate the responsibility of a person to inform their partner if they have an STI. In this way, the CDC counselling of circumcision as a legitimate means of HIV and STI prevention is medically irresponsible.We can see the negative effects of this irresponsibility in high risk areas abroad, where public health campaigns falsely suggest that circumcised men cannot get or pass on HIV. This is disturbing and unethical and it stems from well-respected medical institutions like the CDC making recommendations such as these.

Finally, it is frankly medically illogical to counsel circumcision as a means to prevent HIV and other STIs. I see it as tantamount to counseling parents to have their children's fingers amputated to prevent eczema. Cutting off body parts without considering other means of treatment or prevention has not been considered a legitimate medical practice for over a century. Circumcision impairs the natural function of the penis. If CDC feels comfortable advising medical practitioners based on questionable research studies, then they should also state plainly what we know as fact: Removing the foreskin removes the natural protection for the penis and prevents it from self-lubrication.

I implore the CDC to reconsider how this practice is framed to the public and the medical community, so that people can make adequately informed decisions about their and their childrens' health.</td></tr><tr><td>160</td><td>Anonymous Anonymous</td><td>Dec 4, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0160'>Permalink</a></td><td>This is mutilation!

It seems also extremely misleading to provide recommendations citing a 50-60% reduction in HIV risk without stating that this is based entirely on African data, and only applies to the very specific situation when a man is having unprotected vaginal sex with an HIV-infected women. Given that the supporting documents mention multiple times that most transmission of HIV in the US is male-to-male, this seems like a limited scenario that most men are unlikely to encounter. Moreover, they have the option of the personal choice to use a condom or to not engage in risky sex.

Before making such a broad recommendation, I would hope that the CDC would conduct a more rigorous analysis of the association between circumcision and HIV contraction risk in other countries (particularly in the US, if the recommendation is to be applied here), and clearly acknowledge the limited nature of the data even in a summary. People are often wowed by numbers, and largely will believe the statement that there is a 50-60% reduction in risk without looking more closely.

The Africans that were circumcised in the study were told to refrain from sexual activity while the penis healed from surgery. The men that remained intact were able to freely have sex during the weeks that the other men recovered therefore it is not surprising that the men that had less sex were less likely to get HIV. HIV in Africa is transmitted predominately in heterosexual relationships where HIV in USA is predominately in homosexual relationships.

For the sake of our sons and for the sake of our daughters who may grow up to have a heterosexual relationship, do NOT go thru with this recommendation. In fact, if the government feels the need to recommend anything about male genitals, it should be that the foreskin has MANY sexual benefits including 20,000 nerve endings and the ability to create natural lubrication giving pleasure to both partners. The USA is the highest consumer of sexual lubricant in the world and one of the highest countries of circumcision. (NOT a coincidence!) The clitoris has 8,000 nerve ending and it's illegal to remove that. Why is genetial mutilation continuing and even being recommended in this country in this day and age?

If this goes thru PLEASE also create a document about how to care for a natural/normal/intact penis.

I think it is ridiculous the CDC is advocating circumcision, a (usually) unnecessary and risky medical procedure, on the grounds that it is more hygienic and prevents disease.

There have been recent cases of mohels passing herpes on to infants via ritualistic circumcision. Once circumcised, a baby is usually placed in a diaper, where the open wound will be exposed to feces.

The CDC should be advocating keeping infant genitals intact, teaching proper hygiene techniques, and condom usage to prevent STIs, not elective and dangerous surgery performed without anesthetic.

Around 117 baby boys DIE every year from this cosmetic surgery, nobody has ever died from having their whole body. If slicing up the most sensitive part of your body was actually "cleaner" why would the rest of the world be perfectly healthy and clean? Because the foreskin protects the glans (which was made to be an INTERNAL organ) from dirt and debris. Both male and female bodies produce smegma though and women more so than men but no one is rushing to cut off their labia or clitoral hood. I can't believe Americans would follow some African study that shows whole men that don't speak to anyone continue to spread aids but those gullible enough cut their most pleasurable organ and are then given and told to use condoms also to prevent the spread of disease. Obviously wearing a condom is preventing these diseases NOT genital mutilation! I for one am so glad we found out the truth before it was too late and we have 2 happy healthy boy with their bodily autonomy intact. They will always know their body belongs to them and future sex partners won't have to struggle with painful sex since the foreskin will allow a natural gliding motion unlike rough calloused glans of cut men.

The claim that a procedure which cuts off parts of infants (who will later become adults) without their consent, and is demonstrated to have long lasting damaging effects on sexuality, is a beneficial procedure is a claim that requires substantial evidence. Your committee's cited research is not substantial enough to warrant this recommendation.

Indeed, consider that many countries (like Germany, the UK, Japan, and most others) which do not usually mutilate their children have STI and HIV rates dropping, while the USA and many African countries, who all share the love of cutting children, see our rates soar.

The proper way to deal with STI's and HIV is to educate the public about safe sex and condom use. Telling people to chop off bits and pieces of children without probable cause that those bits will cause harm is wrong, and if these recommendations go through, will go down in history as a great affront against human rights.

Please keep in mind that over 100 boys would have to be circumcised to prevent just one boy from getting a UTI, and out of those 100 boys, 2-3 of them will have hemorrhage (bleeding) issues or infections. In my short time (a few months) working in newborn nursery i have seen choking, several bleedings including a hemorrhage, several that look anatomically crooked cuts, and one who called back with a swollen, infected, draining pus a week later.

I am sure removing breast tissue from newborn baby girls would have "benefits that exceed the risks" in preventing breast cancer (which is exceedingly more common then penile cancer) but we do not routinely recommend that. Removing healthy tissue from a nonconsenting baby is not acceptable, in any form.

Please keep in mind that just because a baby will not remember something, does not mean it ahould be done. A newborn baby would not remember being burned, neglected, or abused either. You would still use pain medication on an alzheimers patient, even if they won't remember the pain.

As a practicing pediatric urologist who both performs circumcisions and has lengthy discussions with patients and families to often dissuade them from performing circumcision if there is no strong medical indication, I want to bring attention to a health policy issue related to this recommendation. My state and 17 others do not provide Medicaid coverage for circumcision unless certain medical criteria are met. In the era of reducing medical costs, particularly as it relates to government assistance, it is unlikely that these states will begin paying this procedure despite new CDC recommendations touting its benefits.

Someday, the owner of the penis may prefer to be intact as millions of other males around the world are living with healthy, intact genitals and do not suffer any medical conditions from being intact--the way nature intended. I urge the CDC to research all of the wonderful functions of the foreskin; it is there for many reasons and by allowing parents to forcibly remove this functional part of the genitalia sends the message to the male population that they do not own their body nor do they have the right to genital integrity. I urge the CDC to look at all risks involved with genital mutilation, including but not limited to death, serious botched procedures, and less sensitivity. Condoms are the best measure for protecting against diseases like HIV, not circumcision. The studies you presented are flawed.

There is no disease and no diagnosis. It is not necessary for optimal health and benefits are so few (and questionable at best) that no medical organization in the world recommends routine infant circumcision. For an elective intervention, such as non-therapeutic circumcision, one must thoroughly examine potential advantages and disadvantages.

The AAP claims 1% risk of UTI, a 1/100,000 risk of penile cancer, 1% risk of phimosis and potential reduction of STI transmission justifies giving parents the choice to choose routine neonatal circumcision for their child, without the childs consent, and without a diagnosis of disease or medical need for a surgery.

9-11% of boys that are circumcised may go on to develop meatal stenosis(Howe), an iatrogenic condition that presents typically only in circumcised boys. Another study states, The incidence of meatal ulceration following circumcision is from 8 to 20 per cent(Williams & Kapila). Meatal stenosis can develop into a very serious health problem that can require corrective surgery under general anesthesia, putting the child at even more risk. A necessary therapeutic surgery to correct an iatrogenic condition which was directly caused by an unnecessary, non-therapeutic surgery.

One study has shown an adhesion rate of 3%. Another has shown that 2% 71% of boys develop adhesions(Ponsky LE1, Ross JH, Knipper N, Kay R.). Perhaps a minor, mostly cosmetic complication, but not one without pain or trouble for the child that could easily be prevented by simply not performing the unnecessary circumcision surgery on a healthy baby that has no need to have his foreskin removed.

Penile cancer accounts for less than 1% of all cancers affecting men in the US. A man only has 1/100,000 risk of ever being diagnosed with penile cancer. One study from the AAP estimates that more than 322,000 newborn circumcisions are required to prevent just 1 penile cancer event per year, but 644 boys would suffer complications from their circumcision.

Concerning UTIs, if 1000 well boys are circumcised, only 8-10 infections may be prevented, but statistics tell us 20 will have a complication related to the circumcision.

Concerning phimosis, only 1% of males will be diagnosed, and several studies have stated that the condition is grossly over-diagnosed in the U.S. due to physician ignorance on the normal anatomy and physiology of the intact penis and that true pathological phimosis requiring circumcision is rare. Studies have demonstrated that patients with true phimosis can be treated successfully with topical creams in 65% to 95% of cases (Howe, 1998). Topical therapy is not only more cost-effective, but is less invasive and has a faster recovery period than circumcision. Considering 1% are only ever diagnosed to begin with, and of that 1% many are misdiagnosed, then consider of the fraction that have true phimosis, the majority of those boys would respond to topical therapy, there you have a very, very, very small number of boys that would ever truly require a medical circumcision due to a problem with their foreskin.

Concerning STIs, condom use is not invasive or painful, less costly, does not remove any tissue from a non consenting minor AND more effective in preventing the transmission of STIs.

Other studies have suggested the overall, general rate of complication is up to 3%, and another stating a realistic figure is 2-10%(Williams & Kapila), which even on the conservative end and ignoring the 9-11% risk of meatal stenosis, is still greater than the risk of UTI, penile cancer and phimosis combined.

To say there are health benefits without first recognizing the complication rate supersedes the benefits is fallacious. The RISKS and disadvantages of circumcision surgery when done routinely and non-therapeutically OUTWEIGH the BENEFITS.

Circumcision has always primarily been a religious and aesthetic practice and it remains so today.

I do, however, have a problem with this particular recommendation. It feels as if the data is being presented in a misleading way. The data regarding the transmission of HIV is from Africa, where the rates of HIV are much higher and access to proper education is limited and use of prophylaxis (i.e. condoms) is taboo. Additionally, it would be much more efficacious to recommend government mandated sexual education classes for children. I worry that this may give the population a false sense of security when it comes to STI spread.
Another concern I have is the fact that circumcision is only known to reduce the rate of transmission TO a male having HETEROSEXUAL sexual intercourse. It has no known effect on homosexual or anal sex. I cannot be known at birth whether a child will be heterosexual or homosexual, and if the child is homosexual, then an unnecessary procedure has been done.
The US is the only industrialized nation that routinely does elective circumcision. Most other countries have policy statements actually AGAINST routine circumcision, and quite frankly, have better health care systems.
Also, the fact that circumcision does reduce the rate of penile cancer is true, but the rate of penile cancer is remarkably low.
I feel that this statement frames circumcision as a recommended procedure. I do not feel that the surgery risks, which not only include bleeding and infection at time of surgery, but also decreased sensation of the penis as an adult, are worth the minimal benefits.
This policy to me seems to be more of a justifcation of what now is a cultural norm. Additionally, I feel that it is only being addressed so that insurance companies will continue to pay for the procedure.

Within the United States, population data does not show that there is any HIV (or STDs) risk advantage for men that have been circumcised. Should not all guidelines as to GSC be based on what US population data shows? Please consider the NAVY study and others that show NO HIV, HPV or STD difference as to American males with natural genitals and American males that have been circumcised.

The data under consideration appears to be based on African studies. There must be some consideration as to why African population data does not match US data before it is considered applicable to the US population.

The CDC must address the glaring issue that men in the EU mostly have natural genitals and a majority of men in the US have been circumcised, yet the EU has much lower HIV, HPV and STD rates than the US.

Your material mentions benefits and risks. However, there is no analysis of:

The harm to infant/boy through loss of protective aspects of tissue amputated.
Loss of nerve endings from the tissue amputated.
Loss of mobile erogenous tissue.
Affects on sexual pleasure and function related to the tissue amputated.
Erectile dysfunction related to the tissue amputated.
Premature ejaculation related to the tissue amputated.
Pain and suffering and potential damage involved in the surgery and recovery.

Please make sure that each of these points is fully considered and addressed before a decision is made to have doctors recommend circumcision. Obviously, there can be no consideration of the risks of circumcision if changes to sexual pleasure and function of the amputated tissue and loss of nerve endings related to the tissue amputated are never even considered.</td></tr><tr><td>198</td><td>Yannos Misitzis</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0198'>Permalink</a></td><td>I believe that other comments in opposition to this recommendation are more fact-supported and eloquent than what I can respond with. What I will contribute is that if there are indeed, large, relevant, representative (both in terms of being non-confounded and applicable to the U.S. demographic), and empirically supported studies as to health benefits from MGM any recommendations must be limited to the following: Physicians may initiate the conversation with their adult clients; if, following any such "recommendations," men choose to follow through with the elective procedure, it is a personal and somewhat informed decision.

My personal opinion is that non-religious circumcision continues to be propagated by generational ignorance of the myriad negative consequences of the act. Continuing circumcision at infancy further reinforces this ignorance and promotes its normalization. Suggesting to new parents (especially those including circumcised fathers) that the procedure prevents HIV/STIs further promotes this cycle of circumcision without choice.

By the tone of my comment, you can probably anticipate what my reaction would be to a physician making these recommendations to me, but any responsible doctor would also recommend the many other, non-surgical precautions against HIV/STIs.

I am personally opposed to the overall recommendation, but I would be vehemently disappointed to see the recommendations enacted as they currently stand.</td></tr><tr><td>199</td><td>Inshirah Mahal</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0199'>Permalink</a></td><td>When I was a little girl and discovered my little brothers had been cut, I was horrified for them and grateful I wasn't born a boy.

Adults are so desensitized to their own bodies, let alone reality, that they have little to no awareness to the damage they do to newborns, let alone older males. You've got an infant laying there completely helpless, with no way to speak up for itself or to stop adults or to convey just how badly pain shocks their nervous/pleasure system, and adults keep doing the same ridiculous nonsense because they are completely lost in their own delusional minds creating imaginative dialogues to support their rationale for cutting infant boys foreskins.

Circumcision is exactly like racism, sexism, homophobia, ageism, slavery; a consensus reality believed to be true because they believe so. Look how long it has taken to break through these dysfunctional isms and all the so called scientific & religious rationalized studies validating these insanities; it's torture...

Let me be blunt about this to put it in perspective: Let's experiment on all those scientists, both male and female, and take some toe nail clippers and start clipping away at their genitalia for the same amount of skin that is cut off of males and do some "scientific studies" on the ramifications of the actual experience without painkillers, rather than some philosophical observations on potential benefits.

The level of fear, guilt, and shame surrounding sexuality and all the rational discourse (fantasizing) to suppress it, control it, avoid it, criminalize it, judge it, legislate it, is indicative of how completely dysfunctional the adults are in being able to bring awareness to the whole truth about sexuality. People are blinded to the damage of sexual suppression because it is not something that is visibly obvious unless one is awake and aware on how the body armors itself in response to suppression, which is where the fear, guilt, and shame come into the bigger picture; and those aren't just mental constructs, they create an immense dis-ease of which all the thinking and believing in the world is not going to "understand." You may think this is irrelevant but it is the root of sexual disease; mental dis-ease.

The problem with science is the questions one asks, dictate the outcomes one gets. I find it exceedingly ignorant of professionals who rather than be completely open and explicit about sexuality at all levels in body/mind/spirit, would rather avoid being EXPLICIT to avoid the whole truth. You don't want the truth, instead you opt for a sterile discourse that maintains the same insanity of beliefs and circular thinking that maintains strict control of sex. Avoidance of truth is an addiction in our culture and it is like the alcoholic in the family who is the elephant in the living room everyone ignores.

Adults avoid this because it is indicative of how they avoid their own authentic selves buried deep under years of conditioned thinking and believing otherwise; the immense power of conformity and peer pressure is your blind spot. Awareness doesn't need beliefs to realize the truth and that's the difference from where your organization perceives things and those of us who choose to be completely aware. I remember what it was like getting cut. There are no words for it, because that is part of the insanity of the sort of mental discourse you imprison yourself into to avoid the reality of a helpless infant or child to be forced; domination and control.

Physical, mental, and emotional pain has to be endured; it's called trauma (PTSD). This pain infliction also gives rise to distrust of adults who profess to care about them; this shock creates a disembodiment of spirit. Pain is not visible, so you aren't going to observe the energetic twisting and winding occurring when the pain hits; since there's no where for that immense pain to go, it binds up causing emotional blockages.

Now you want to target teenagers to get circumcised to reduce the risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. What happened to condoms? What happened to teenage sex education (heterosexual, bisexual, homosexual), discussion of masturbation and contraceptives as healthy ways of preventing sexual dis-ease?

None of the recent articles I've read stemming from your recent stand for circumcision state any of these other options. In addition, the use of the word critics for those who don't agree with your mental construct is indicative of your own dysfunction. There have always been people who spoke up about dysfunction/abuse and they were perceived as critics or heretics. You are blinded by what you know, which prevents you from seeing what you don't know.

When another person makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over. He does not need punishment; he needs help.

As someone who was circumcised as a baby, it has made me seriously depressed that I was never given control over my own body. Circumcision is a very traumatic event for babies and even though people can't consciously remember being circumcised, it is well known that traumatic events effect the development of children. For example, circumcised male children have a lower pain tolerance than uncut males and females. All the resources that go into promoting genital mutilation would lead to better health outcomes if they were put into proper sex education and birth control distribution. Why should we be mutilating babies so protect them from STDs when they aren't sexually active and when people become sexually active (& would therefore allegedly benefit from being circumcised) they are old enough to decide for themselves if they want to be circumcised? Circumcised men are less likely to use condoms since so many nerves are already taken away/the foreskin isn't gliding over the glans inside the condom like with uncut penises, so it is unfair to women as well since they are more likely to get an STD from a circumcised partner since he is less likely to wear a condom. Medical associations in countries that don't practice circumcision are more firmly against circumcision since those doctors don't feel a need to justify what was done to them. This is a truly shameful practice and advocating taking away the rights and proper sexual function of males must be stopped, even remaining neutral as to avoid controversy allows this crime to continue happening. It should be illegal to circumcise minors, period. I say this as a victim of circumcision, please just let men have autonomy over their own genitals!

Infant circumcision is indefensible from a medical, ethical, and human rights point of view.

The U.S. is the only industrialized nation circumcising a majority of boys for non-religious and non-medical reasons. In fact, countries all across Europe are now looking to prohibit infant circumcision.

Circumcision is a painful, risky, unethical surgery that deprives over a million boys each year of healthy, functional tissue, while wasting health care dollars that could be spent on medically necessary services.

Infant circumcision drains scarce public health resources for a medically unnecessary procedure. If the rationale is to stop the spread of sexually transmitted disease, there are far less harmful, more cost-effective, and more reliable ways to achieve this.

Even if we don't point out the risks of circumcisions, and how completely unethical it is to perform a cosmetic surgery on an un consenting minor, then let us point out the hypocrisy of why female genital mutilation is illegal while male genital mutilation is being promoted by you. Women have a lot of so called issues, but we take it as normal, because it is.... normal. Females are at a higher risk of uti's than their male counterparts, females have way more smegma than males, females are odorous, intact there are huge sections of department stores dedicated to keeping female genitals smelling nice. Females suffer yeast infections and many many other things. Yet females are trusted to clean themselves, and have their bodily autonomy respected. Females get prescribed antibiotics, not parts of their genitals forcible cut off. Why are boys not protected the same way?! The only legitimate answer is money. The CDC and every medical personnel who promotes male genital mutilation is thoroughly repulsive, and leads to an overall distrust in the establishment. How can the rest of the civilized world know how barbaric, cruel, and unnecessary circumcision is, yet the most powerful country in the world is still so far behind in regards to this basic human rights issue.

How dare you allow this misinformation to be spread, and for boys to be hurt in such an damaging way. To circumcise an infant, the attending doctor must give the baby an erection, then use a probe to force the fused foreskin off and away from the glans. Then they use some form of further torture to remove the foreskin, or use that nasty contraption the plastibell, which lets the foreskin rot and fall off. To me and many others, the surgery resemble a rape and torture, and all for a cosmetic surgery on a minor who is incapable of giving consent, or fighting you off! Have I mentioned how unethical this is. What happened to 'first do no harm'?

I am a mother of two boys who were left intact as newborns. I am a professional with a master's degree and a child's rights advocate. My sons were not circumcised as newborns because their father (who is circumcised) and I looked at all of the research behind the practice of circumcision and decided that the supposed benefits do not outweigh the risks, and the claims of benefit absolutely do not outweigh the loss of healthy, normal tissue. We easily knew that it is not our right to tamper with our children's god-given bodies especially since we concluded that there are no real benefits to this culturally rooted procedure.

I have a serious concern with these proposed federal recommendations. First, my family may have to continually defend our decision to keep our children intact, to our health care provider. Second, my sons may be pressured to undergo this surgery based on the cultural preferences of our country, and not based on legitimate and relevant science. And third, such a recommendation implies condonation of genital surgery on nonconsenting infants.

My sons will be taught to use condoms and practice other methods to protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases. This, after all, is the only way to prevent such diseases. Please do two things before you make this very important decision:
1. Identify the rates of circumcision and HIV in other countries. Are there other objective conclusions to draw from this data?
2. Reflect on how your own cultural bias may lead to erroneous conclusions.

A human's genital integrity is about the most personal and intimate decision that can be made. Presumably, that is why it is illegal to alter the genitals of a minor female child. One can only question the morality of those who believe that females have the right to genital integrity and males don't.

The foreskin primarily exists as protection to the glans penis, and the gliding motion reduces friction during sexual intercourse, therefore lessening the possibility of micro tears in the genitalia of both partners. Removing it can only result in a scarred, less sensitive penis that results in more violent sex.

Needless to say, I highly disagree with the CDC's decision to force circumcision on young males and males of all ages when there is no real evidence that circumcision reduces the transmission of STDs in the USA. This is especially obnoxious when considering the fact that in Western Europe the HIV and STD transmission rate is substantially lower than it is in the USA despite the fact that circumcision there is rare.

Let's review the empirical evidence. The AIDS epidemic in the 1980's persisted in the USA despite the fact that roughly 90% of sexually active males were circumcised at that time. This disease was primarily spread in the gay community where anal sex was common and among injection drug users. There was no epidemic among straight men. Presently, the incidence of HIV/AIDS is higher in the USA than in all European countries. Circumcision is rare in Europe, except among Jews and Muslim, and there is no epidemic of AIDS (or any other sexually transmitted disease) among these millions of intact men. Safe sex practices should be promoted rather than unnecessary surgery. Circumcision prevents nothing.

The use of the so-called African HIV trials is at best suspect, and the application of those research findings in a totally different cultural and medically advanced country such as ours is a fraudulent use of the data. The trials were cut short so long-term follow-up was impossible to see if the infection rate rose among circumcised men over time. Every informed doctor knows that having frequent unprotected sex with partners of unknown or positive HIV status, will result in the male contracting HIV whether circumcised or intact. Even the researchers state that a male should always use a condom, circumcised or intact, to be fully protected from HIV. So the questions that begs an answer is, why get circumcised if you have to wear a condom anyway? It also needs to be more clearly stated that male circumcision does not prevent HIV infection at all, the so-called studies only point to a slowing of the rate of infection in the short term.

Quoting from the AAP statement in your draft guidance only compounds the misinformation being circulated by a group of physicians who are primarily concerned about their loss of revenue if circumcision becomes more rare. The very statement that concludes with the phrase "that the procedure should be covered by third party insurance" reveals the real motivation of the AAP stance--to insure payment for a procedure that the AAP even admits cannot be recommended for medical reasons. Likewise, the lack of reliable data on the incidence of complications from circumcision makes the notion that the benefits outweigh the risks meaningless--what are the risks (there are may more than noted in your guidance), how often do complications occur (more than rough estimates are needed for informed guidance), and nowhere is infant mortality from circumcision mention even though there are many death annually (there would be no infant deaths from circumcision if the surgery were never performed except in cases where there was urgent medical necessity).

The CDC should be a provider of medical guidance, not an advocate for religious or cultural practices that have developed over the years. The CDC should strongly state that there are only potential benefits, and that these advertised benefits are marginal at best. Safe sex practices work better for safeguarding adults from HIV than circumcision. Even circumcised males must use a condom to be protected. Using the HIV argument when advocating for infant circumcision is just plain wrong/unethical. The infant is not at risk for contracting HIV. If a male wished to have himself circumcised when he becomes sexually active, it can be his decision at that time.

Finally, performing unnecessary cosmetic surgery on a minor, even if requested by a parent, is unethical conduct. The doctor must always do what is in the best interest of the patient. Infant circumcision is not medically necessary so a doctor may not legitimately perform the surgery even with parental consent. Doctors have to develop a backbone and simply tell parents "no, I don't perform medically unnecessary surgery." When I have confronted pediatricians with the question, "what other body part will you remove at parental request?" they respond that it is an unfair question. Why unfair. If these doctors are performing medically unnecessary surgery simply because a parent request it, the question is completely valid. The AAP statement enshrines the notion that parents are the ones to decided if their son should be circumcised. This is a blatant attempt to circumvent medical ethics by abandoning the professional responsibility of the doctor to only recommend medically necessary procedures. Doctors should be practitioners of competent medicine, not conduits for fulfilling parental, cultural or religious preferences.

To impose an irreversible body modification on an infant who may someday wish he still had all of his body parts is just plain wrong. Saying that the surgery is easier and safer in infancy is a specious argument if the surgery never needs to be performed at all. Safer & easier doesn't = right.</td></tr><tr><td>227</td><td>Anthony Cramer</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0227'>Permalink</a></td><td>The African studies upon which these recommendations are based all suffer from the same fatal flaw - they're dependent on self-reporting of behavior that's the subject of multiple, and often conflicting, tribal taboos and superstitions. And it's also clear, from material directly cited in other CDC reports, that many of the individuals mentioned in these surveys have fallen victim to the rampant misinformation on the subject (for example, that circumcised men no longer need to use condoms). The entire difference in inferred (notice that I did NOT say observed) STD infection rates between intact and mutilated men can be explained by one simple fact: an intact male is more likely to break a condom thanks to the increased skin mobility of the natural penis. How many of the uncut African men (or their wives and/or mistresses) in these studies were even instructed about the necessity of fully retracting the foreskin before rolling on a condom? And do any data about this particular aspect of the problem even exist?

Any recommendation of circumcision for infants should be off the table for the reasons of human rights and patient choice outlined in numerous comments already posted here - it's morally indefensible, point, period, end of sentence. And the CDC has about as much business recommending it for older males as it does advocating breast augmentation or face-lifts for women. The other medical "indications" are themselves just so much hogwash; the incidence of penile cancer among the uncircumcised is even lower than that of breast cancer within the entire male population, so why don't we just counsel men to undergo prophylactic mastectomy while we're at it? The vast majority of Urinary Tract Infections are easily dealt with, at a cost that pales in comparison to the several documented infant sex-change operations that were performed in the US over the last decade as a direct result of botched circumcisions. So the recommendation that insurers cover the procedure just adds insult to injury - not only will every insurance policyholder end up subsidizing a "treatment" that many find abhorrent, but the imprimatur of a government agency will give providers cover to continue a practice whose primary historical justification has always been padding the bill for a hospital birth, with so-called "benefits" that in no way whatsoever justify the ancillary costs.</td></tr><tr><td>228</td><td>James Davis</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0228'>Permalink</a></td><td>Please take a look at how this study has either no control group or a improperly designed control group, one that was created in order to support the desired results.

But the thought of putting a baby through ANY medical procedure, with all its pain and risks, without a pressing need is appalling to me.
The logic behind the CDC's report should lead to equal treatment of girls, right? We should remove the breasts of girls and women, because then they won't get breast cancer. We should join those who cut parts off the genitals of girls, so-called female circumcision, because less tissue means less HIV, right? And we should start routine infant appendectomies, since many people suffer complications with that "useless" organ.
All I just said is ludicrous, I know! But the CDC apparently does not see that. Fortunately most other medical organizations in the world are not so blinded by the money made off of circumcision here in the US.

The United States is already alone in the world regarding the routine cutting of genitals of infants. The barbaric and outmoded surgery forced upon non-consenting infants is one of the most shameful parts of American culture.

Why are males singled out in this recommendation? Perhaps the CDC should recommend the cutting of infant vulvas or clitoral hoods. Female genitalia are notoriously hard to keep clean and are prone to infection. Routine mastectomy would be a big cost-savings for the United States, since breast cancer is both extremely prevalent and deadly.

Condoms prevent HIV and STI infection, and antibiotics cure UTIs. Counseling parents to cut their infant sons or counseling intact men to cut off their foreskins seems incredibly drastic in light of the simple, effective, and low-cost measures that are already proven to work to prevent HIV/STIs and cure UTIs.

The United States already has one of the highest rates of male circumcision in the world and also has some of the highest rates of HIV and STIs in the developed world, so it would seem that the recommendation to continue the status quo is poor public health policy. Education regarding safer sex is always the best way to reduce infection. Is your message that 'If you are cut, don't worry about safe sex?' That could easily become the takeaway from this recommendation.

After a great deal of research, I chose not to have my son circumsiced. My husband is circumcised and we did not feel that our son needed to "match" his daddy purely for aesthetic reasons.

I am concerned that the CDC is making these recommendations using one study done in Africa (not another industrialized nation). Statistically the difference according to this one study only is between 1-2% change. I feel the resulting claims are misleading. Even if it were true that circumsiced men were less likely to get HIV or STDs, I don't see why prophalaxis cutting of the labia or breast buds insn't encouraged for females. Wouldn't that prevent breast cancer, which is far more likely for a baby girl to develop than the risks a boy has by having his foreskin? Wouldn't removal of labial tissue keep things more clean on a woman? I think we can trust a man or teenage boy to pull back his foreskin and wash it with water, just as women wash their labia. We don't prophylactically remove any other part of an infant. Additionally, the CDC is recommending condom usage regardless. So an intact man or teenager could use a condom and not have to undergo surgery to remove an important part of his body. Removal of foreskin via routine infant circumsicion affects a man's ability to produce lubrication and also makes him more likely to have erectile dysfunction.

Furthermore, infants do feel pain and are not given adequate pain medications for circumsicion. There is no true medical reason for circumcision. The reasons listed in America in favor of the practice (UTIs, STDs, HIV, penile cancer) are not rampant in European countries where only a small portion of the population is circumsiced. I would like to see the CDC examine differences between America and one of these countries.

My husband and I chose not to have our son circumsiced because we feel it is our son's right to make that choice for himself. The only reason that babies later "need" to be circumsiced is due to improper care of the intact penis (The foreskin should only by retracted by the owner of it, and the median age is 10, not 3. Sometimes a foreskin is not ready to retract until a boy is a teenager. This makes sense as the process is governed by hormones).

We consider it mutilation to perform genital surgeries on infant girls. I do not understand why a boy's body is any different. Circumsicion is rarely necessary, is a practice that was begun in America to prevent masturbation, and is essentially elective plastic surgery. It is a cultural tradition that no longer dominates any other industrialized nation. Baby boys deserve bodily integrity. Circumsicion is a money making business in the U.S. I don't believe anyone would make the choice to have their son cirumsiced if they fully researched it and witnessed it being done.</td></tr><tr><td>235</td><td>Nick Hagen</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0235'>Permalink</a></td><td>In 1987 shortly after my birth my parents made the abhorrent decision to have my genitals mutilated without any medical cause. My genitals were not deformed and they did not suffer any infections. They were, I can only assume, in perfect working order. That is until a doctor took a scalpel and, without medical cause, surgically removed healthy tissue from my penis and threw it in the garbage.
Today I am bewildered and disgusted to see that the Centers for Disease control has endorsed the use of genital mutilation as a means to combat the spread of HIV. Just to be clear, no HIV positive person should be having unprotected sex with anyone else regardless of whether or not they have foreskin. The studies cited by the CDC were conducted in a flawed manner; exposing living breathing human being to a deadly disease, showed no regard for the women exposed to aids by the test subjects, and instructed the newly circumcised men to refrain from sex while they were healing from surgery (intentionally skewing the results). There is a reason why no recent studies have replicated the results of these studies because they represent bad science working in the service of religious law.
The African continent for example has one of the highest circumcision rates in the world and yet is ground zero for this disease. The African continent does not lack for circumcisions and certainly does not lack HIV.
I stated it above and I will state it again because it bears repeating; no HIV positive person should be having unprotected sex with anyone else regardless of whether or not they are circumcised. By telling men without foreskin that they will neither contract nor spread HIV is one of the most dangerous and morally abhorrent things I have heard.
The CDC will profit nothing by encouraging young circumcised men to have unprotected sex even if they are at risk of contracting or spreading HIV.
The spread of HIV will be halted by education and safe sex.
Please, stop this cycle and prevent another generation of mutilated young men.

As a physician myself, and circumcised as a teenager because of phimosis, I can attest to the negative consequences that would be very difficult to capture in an uncontrolled study.

Circumcision should remain solely restricted to the religious/ cultural context that it historically was, and a matter of choice of the parents, and not a public health policy in this country.

Females at any age have a great number of UTIs than males, yet we aren't advocating chopping off body parts of females.....in fact, female circumcision is illegal here in the USA. Why is that? Could it be because it is cruel, gruesome, and barbaric? Probably so.....same as in male circumcision.

Bacteria can be found under fingernails, on door handles, on shopping carts, and in the air of popular public meeting places, yet surgically removing fingernails is absolutely absurd, and living as a recluse to avoid germs, bacteria, and viruses is considered a mental disorder.

Instead, why not actually suggest that males undergo voluntary circumcision when they can consent and when they are at an appropriate age to even have sex? If this were the case, then your research would probably reveal a different story entirely and there would be much greater risk involved.

While an argument can be made for medical benefits to male circumcision, as well as against it (for instance, the studies do not account for the hygienic and medical practices in the United States, nor the low rates of heterosexual HIV transmission in the United States), it is very important that we look at something the current proposal neglects: human rights.

What are the ethics involved here? Is it acceptable to remove a functional part of the human body from an infant - a human being - without that person's consent? In this case, it is not a matter of life or death, and though there may be some preventive benefits (which are questionable), it may well also constitute a violation of the person's rights. Without considering this fact, without giving it so much as passing consideration, we are beginning down a dangerous path.

I beg that you please spend a bit of time thinking over these matters, and give them due consideration in your final report. Personally, I do not believe you should recommend circumcision at all.

If the foreskin was truly as bad as some claim then evolution would have or would be in the process of removing it herself through evolution, but the fact is that foreskin is a good thing. There are many benefits to having one and absolutely no benefits to being circumcised. All studies saying otherwise have been debunked or are flawed in some way. Besides, the countries that practice female circumcision believe the same things about it as our society believes about males - that it's cleaner, more attractive, et cetera. So why would one be okay and not the other?

Also please keep in mind the majority of the male population isn't circumcised (I believe it's about 80% percent if I remember correctly) and they are perfectly fine. Chopping off healthy pieces of a baby though with little to no anesthesia? That's going to leave permanent scars both on their bodies and on their minds as it has been proven to negatively effect the confidence of boys later on. That sort of pain response, especially so early on a developing mind, will change that child in very negative ways. That is if they live through it since an estimated 117 babies die per year in America alone from botched circumcisions and then there's the chance of something else going wrong, leaving the man that baby will eventually grow into to be in pain and embarrassment for his whole life.

No, it is simply better to educate one's self about how to properly care for a foreskin, which basically boils down to don't retract it as a child (that will 'cause an infection or tear as it is fused to the glans until later on) and once it retracts to clean it off all you have to do is wipe it off like a finger and all men have to do is while in the shower pull it back and rinse it out for five seconds.

I would think, that if these findings were true and could have such a large impact of the health of Americans, that most intact men in the U.S. and worldwide, would be lining up to have the procedure. Not one state health department recommends this, including the AAP. They stated "the procedure is not essential to a child's current well-being ... however, existing scientific evidence is not sufficient to recommend routine circumcision. Therefore, because the procedure is not essential to a child's current well-being, we recommend that the decision to circumcise is one best made by parents in consultation with their pediatrician, taking into account what is in the best interests of the child, including medical, religious, cultural, and ethnic traditions." The issue with this statement and what is proposed by the CDC, is that the term "personal" isn't referencing the person who's body will be affected, but a third party (the parents, doctors, religious leaders, etc.). What other medical procedure is allowed, condoned, PAID for, based on "religious, cultural, and ethnic traditions?"

The least invasive forms of female genital cutting are less harmful than routine infant circumcision. Even a pinprick on a girl's genitals is banned. Male circumcision removes what will become about 10 square inches of skin, half of which is the inner foreskin, which has been shown to be the most sensitive part of the male genitalia.

Banning the least invasive form of FGC while allowing full excision of a large portion of the erogenous genitalia of a boy is sexist.

Granting women a right to genital integrity that is not granted to men violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution and as such, the FGC ban is unconstitutional. The only way to make the FGC ban constitutional is to render it gender neutral.

A majority of the world does not practice circumcision and they are doing just fine. The United States is a developed country with an advanced healthcare system, as well as easy access to various forms of protection from STD/STIs. Circumcision is not a miracle "cure all" treatment for diseases, it is simply a subject about the bottom line: money. It is a huge money maker for doctors and the healthcare industry perpetuated by creating fear in parents of newborn children. Of course if you tell them their son will more than likely get HIV and HPV, and give their partner cancer, they'll do the procedure. But look at Europe: where is the UK's epidemic? If foreskin was a terrible appendage, why are they doing well and staying healthy? Sexual education. They have a far superior sexual education program to provide their population with the information necessary to prevent spread of diseases, and how to take care of themselves. Most programs in the US ignore the foreskin, which leads to problems for boys that could be avoided. If they are not told how their foreskin functions, of course they may develop an issue. That is not the fault of the foreskin, but the fault of our education and health system.

Simply by educating the population that foreskin is a normal part of the body, they will accept it for what it is, and treat it like any other appendage. Circumcision is a cosmetic procedure that occasionally is used for medical purposes. Yes, some men ay need the procedure, or desire the procedure, but it is not fair for a doctor or parent to do that to them before they are old enough to understand it. An adult is making a physical change to a human that they aren't consenting to that alters how a sexual organ functions. Yes, a parent has the power to make medical decisions for their children, but the basis of these decisions are highly biased and clouded with lies. The top reasons circumcision is recommended is based on outdated ideas, such as "matching" their father, cleanliness, and social acceptance. A child should not be shamed for having an unaltered body. A male that hasn't been circumcised is brought up to believe that sexual partners will be disgusted, and possibly contract diseases because their body is as nature intended. Again, the US is a developed country with easy access to bathing. They can be cleaned, and treated as necessary.

This procedure is a cosmetic procedure falsely advertised as a preventative one that has no use until the individual become sexually active. Testing should be done within our own country and similarly developed countries to determine how circumcision affects health. One can look at European countries for guidance--after several visits there, I have yet to see pro-circumcision medical suggestions, nor was their fear of disease from men with foreskin. They treated the unaltered human body as it should--up to that individual. Sure, a doctor can explain that it is an option, but it should not be the goal of the doctor to persuade a patient or parent to do the procedure simply because it "may" prevent something in the future.

Circumcision is not the same medical decision as vaccinations--a baby/child will not catch an STI or HIV from simply having a foreskin, and when they are sexually active, it will not matter if he is circumcised or not; if he has unprotected or promiscuous sexual activities, he will likely catch something. That is the fault of their own actions, not that of an appendage.

The CDC should reevaluate their guidelines, and study those of other healthy countries that do not practice this procedure. Doctors today are informed based on their own opinion and outdated information. They should not suggest or "counsel" a patient on what to do, they should simply let them know the option is there IF they ask for it, or show signs of trouble. Parents do not put their children on a certain medication because they "may" have a problem, or they "may" want to be on it in the future. They do so after they show symptoms, struggle, or request help. Just like a parent wouldn't advise another parent on how to raise their child, a doctor should be there to help a child that needs it, not help one that may need it.

Please, look at Europe, Canada, Australia, and even in America to base studies on how foreskin or lack there of affects health. Africa is not an effective source of information when it comes to health and safety that is used to alter the American medical industry. And please to do not recommend the procedure as a certain way of preventing something. It is all speculation that only seems to apply to the US health system, while a majority of the world functions just fine without circumcision. Would be cut out the appendix at birth because the child may develop appendicitis? No, we wait to see if it is necessary. Doctors and the CDC should protect the people and their bodies.</td></tr><tr><td>258</td><td>Anna M</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0258'>Permalink</a></td><td>This is yet one of the most absurd recommendations coming from cdc I have ever heard of.

Will they be advised that their son can choose to be circumcised when he's older if he wants to, and will insurance companies be encouraged to cover the procedure for adults?

I realized that a lot of parents aren't comfortable with the idea of talking about sexual health and STD prevention with their sons, but this is exactly why I'm concerned about infant circumcision being presented as a viable preventative method on it's own. If pediatricians are going to tell parents that circumcision can reduce the risk of STD infection, they should also discuss things like condom use, the HPV vaccine, and the importance of a comprehensive sex education, so that parents aren't inadvertently led to think that circumcision is all the protection their son will need.</td></tr><tr><td>261</td><td>Anonymous Anonymous</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0261'>Permalink</a></td><td>This is a giant load of you know what.

The CDC's job to provide the medical recommendations, so I will only address those right now.

Let's talk about evidence based medicine here. If we are supposed to assess our patient population (Americans, and are we considering just neonates, or lifelong benefits/risks?), then intervention (circumcision), then the comparison (not circumcised), and finally the outcome (better sexual/genital health), what type of clinical question do we need to ask? What type of study would best answer our clinical question? Why are we including the African studies in the CDC report when the rate of HIV is different in males vs females (equal in Africa, very skewed towards males in the US)? Our risks in the US are different and this needs to be addressed.

I am assuming in this case, the CDC's question is if circumcision is recommended over no circumcision in infant males in America to provide better health outcomes. This means we are looking at this at the level of public health, and need some statistics relevant to our population. Do any of these studies compare doing the surgery on a neonate versus an older child? Does that change the ethics of the question (it should not, if it does, that raises deeper issues about the surgery).
There are some referenced cross sectional study of who is circumcised and who isn't and their dermatological concerns from sexually transmitted infections. I think it needs to be made clear to new parents how small the benefit of circumcision is. There needs to be numbers in the report. I think that more parents, especially first time parents, want more information on what this procedure may actually protect their sons from. As it stands the recommendation is so generic and recommends circumcision though the benefits are very little.</td></tr><tr><td>290</td><td>Jane Hiatt</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0290'>Permalink</a></td><td>I am appalled that we are still recommending circumcision and that the CDC is advocating it as the healthier option.

Both sides seem quite capable of presenting their arguments by using statistics. But the over reliance on statistics obscures the larger issue. It's as if the decision-makers within the CDC and AAP only understand something if it can be measured and reduced to statistics. That way of thinking turns men and boys into little more than machines that you can remove parts from at will. It takes away their humanity. This short essay may skip around a little. I hope it will at least be read by someone.

First, I'd like to know if any independent psychiatrists and psychologists have been involved in your decision-making process. Doctors and researchers who only deal with statistical analysis may give psychological and emotional issues short shrift. But it would be foolish to proceed without fully considering them, wouldn't it?

Those advocating for male circumcision should look at some of the growing body of literature that condemns it. No other surgery removes healthy tissue from the person being operated on without his consent. The AAP makes a very weak argument when they say that the decision to circumcise or not should be left up to the parents. This ignores the reality that parents do not own their children. Parents have the moral obligation to act in the best interests of the child, but how can that extend to unnecessary, cosmetic surgery that causes so much pain to the baby?

It is understood that all parts of the body are interconnected. As the penis is so critical to the male, and to his self-esteem, how can cutting off part of it have no affect elsewhere? Surely we know that it affects the functioning of the brain, even though most men are not consciously aware of it.

I'm one of those men who is aware. I've suffered with an anxiety disorder as far back as I can remember. It became worse as a teenager and yet worse, free-floating GAD, after I entered my twenties. It held me back in school, in my career, and especially in my personal and sexual life. Constant anxiety also led to depression. I consider myself to be halfway intelligent, but could never get to the root of my disorder. I made it all the way to retirement, still not knowing.

One day I stumbled across an article condemning circumcision. It suddenly hit me that my circumcisions (I had to have a follow-up) may have had something to do with my condition. Ever since, I've become obsessed and have gained much understanding of its history and its deleterious effects on the psyche as well as on the organ itself. I know I'm not alone. Can I prove that circumcision led directly to my anxiety disorder? No, I can't, but to me it's the only thing that makes sense. And I'm not happy about having my foreskin removed without my consent.

Modern medicine's view of circumcision, at least as practiced in the United States, seems to mostly ignore any issues that cannot be easily quantified. It's laughable that some pro-circumcision studies still deny that it has any negative sexual side effects. The Jewish doctor and philosopher from the twelfth century, Moses Maimonides, knew better. He wrote that it did blunt sexual pleasure and went into considerable detail. I'm sure that you've all heard of him. It's amazing that what was known centuries ago has largely been lost in the present day US. Is it denial because most male medical doctors in the US have themselves been circumcised?

Lastly, the decision-makers of the CDC should take a look at the possible connection between circumcision and rape. It doesn't appear that it has been studied much in this country, but I've read that some European countries have done so. They've found that most rapes are committed by circumcised men, even in countries where few men are circumcised. If the link could be proven, it would be a game changer indeed, wouldn't it? So why isn't it being studied here when Europe has already shown a link?

It really annoys me that US medicine is so far behind most of the developed world when it comes to circumcision. And, with new guidelines by the AAP, and now maybe the CDC, coming out in favor of circumcision, it appears that the US is deliberately disregarding the views of other countries that have reached the opposite conclusions. I implore you to think outside of the chains of US conventional wisdom and look at this from a larger perspective than just issues like UTI's/HIV/penile cancer, etc.

Every year boys die from circumcision. It is a lifetime decision that cannot be taken back. Every person should be entitled to genital autonomy. We protect girls. Boys need the same protection.

Our Jewish pediatrician argued against it, based on recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics. We had two more sons, and we also did not circumcise them. I have learned more about circumcision since then, and I'm thankful that their doctor advised against it. The original purposes for circumcision were to mark people as members of a particular group and to make sex less enjoyable for them, so as to control their sexual urges. In that regard it has something in common with female genital mutilation. Surely we no longer think of people as uncontrollably driven by sensory urges. For that matter, sex is no longer taboo or considered perverse. Appropriately expressed, sexuality is one of the most meaningful, life-affirming, important aspects of being human. Cutting off parts of baby boys' genitalia should not be undertaken lightly. I am not convinced the CDC has given good enough reasons.

I have serious concerns about blithely recommending genital mutilation for public health issues that can be addressed in less extreme and less dangerous ways. The report mentions HPV transmission. There's a vaccine for that now. Vaccinate all male and female children and you eliminate HPV as a risk to all of them, without any surgery. It also mentions other sexually transmitted infections. What about appropriate hygiene and use of barrier methods/spermicide? Shouldn't people be doing that anyway, whether or not the man is circumcised? What does circumcision add to the mix? As a woman, I certainly wouldn't fall for some new partner assuring me I would not contract an infection from him because he has no foreskin. Would you? Are STI's a big problem in Europe, which has lower incidences of circumcision? Why or why not? Except for HIV/AIDS, aren't STI's curable? Are we foisting off onto individual behavior a larger public health issue of inadequate access to medical care?

The report glosses over the very real physical and psychological risks of inflicting that kind of pain and suffering on helpless babies.

I am not sure if members of the CDC have a hang-up on the fact that many 'normal' men DO have a perfectly functioning foreskin.. and they don't. Or that the chance of profits for both the operation and the sale of the removed skin outweighs any form of ethical practice.

The constant use of the flawed report re Circumcision and HIV totally misses the fact that a use of a Condom would provide even MORE benefit.. Likewise the study was done in Africa which has very few parallels in the rest of the world.

When a young boy enters into adolescence and find the enjoyment that his intact body can give him - I can see a lot of derision if a doctor tries to tell him to get 'cut' and have a sensitive and pleasurable part of him removed. Even worse if his well intentioned parent force him the get the operation.

I live in Australia, originally from the UK. Being a gay man I have met many males both intact and circumcised. Very few of my intact lovers have problems - however that is not the case for my circumcised ones.

Tightness of the skin when erect, loss of sensitivity and the inability to climax.. or the opposite - inability to control their climax. Skin bridges.. And with many of them a understanding that they have been mutilated at birth without their consent.

Currently under the laws of the USA - even applying a pin prick to a baby girls genitals is called as abuse.. and yet tearing the foreskin from the glans and cutting it, often without pain relief is normal. Even if a young boy want tattoos like his dad - he cannot get them as that is likewise abuse.

Sadly I cannot see the logic behind the reasoning.

This fact is in opposition to the data used to justify the CDC's new draft recommendations on male circumcision- which are based on studies conducted in African third world countries where heterosexual transmission of HIV prevails. When one puts all the scientific evidence from Africa aside, the CDC's recommendation to indirectly promote circumcision as a means of HIV/STD prevention (by explaining its benefits to expectant parents and heterosexual male adults/adolescents) really boils down to cultural norms and biases surrounding the procedure. The biases and cultural norms favoring male circumcision in the U.S. is simply not prevalent in the majority of other developed Western nations. My questions since 2007 have always been: 1)How can you say that circumcision will provide a significant public health benefit to a country where female-to-male heterosexual HIV transmission is much less common than MSM transmission; and 2) If the results of the African studies you cite can actually be extrapolated to heterosexual populations in the developed West, then why haven't medical societies and health authorities in Europe adopted similar policies and recommendations?

From what I've read in the literature, the majority of HIV infections in European countries, as in the U.S., also stem from high-risk MSM sexual relations. If data from the African studies (cited by the CDC) could be applied to the general populace in Europe, surely the health authorities in those countries would have drafted circumcision recommendations similar to that recently published by the CDC. The fact that European medical societies and health authorities have not similarly promoted circumcision as a means of HIV prevention in their own populace (as part of a larger prevention program) clearly indicates cultural bias on the part of the CDC and American medical societies. I challenge someone at the CDC to prove to me that similar recommendations (in European countries) ARE being actively considered.</td></tr><tr><td>298</td><td>Brandon Boykin</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0298'>Permalink</a></td><td>This is disgusting.

My younger brother's circumcision was botched and it incredibly impacted his whole life. Although done before leaving the hospital, it was an open wound still when he walked. A year later. He was toilet trained the day he walked--no doubt to protect himself from the burning. And then it finally healed. Then, when I was about 16, and living in a completely different place, an exhausted next door neighbor woman came carrying her baby for my mother's help. She said the kid had been screaming and bleeding since coming home from the hospital days before. Her first boy. She assumed she just needed an experienced mother's help. It was a mess. My mother helped clean it, and taped it in place, pulled down so it would not tear open every time he moved. My mom didn't tell her it was cut beyond usual. After she left, we talked about it being bad. When he was 2, he went to the same doctor with meningitis but was just sent home with meds for a cold. He died at home the next day. I wondered if the doctor realized the penis was ruined and "let him go". This was all 50 years and more ago, but it is still going on. The mothers are the care-givers, and nobody talks to them. Ruined penis is usually kept a deep secret. How could one sheltered female see two in a lifetime? Plus another relative's baby whose head was lightly "skinned". It healed up to look okay but maybe there was decreased sensitivity. Obviously a close call for worse damage.

Seeing one gone wrong is traumatic for the observer. It is obviously torture for the baby. I think the modern nations of Europe have proved it unnecessary. It is emotionally disturbing for some men, doctors, religions to question it. It is a money maker, very rarely needed. Other religions, like my Mormonism, are hypocrites about it, as the Book of Mormon is clearly against it. It is just done mindlessly because that's how the father is.

The whole idea of it being torture in the ancient cultures where it originates, and a step up from murdering the child, and no informed consent for the person who will have to live with it, in a non emergency, non urgent setting-- should all be strong factors against it.

"Father Abraham" was resisting the commandment of a stern god to kill his first-born son, and instead killed the ram and circumcised all the males of his household as a substitute sacrifice.

It relies heavily on studies conducted in Africa, while ignoring a preponderance of evidence in the first world that circumcision does not reduce the risk of HIV transmission.

Furthermore, it must be stated in the document that this is an elective surgery. It is not a treatment, nor a preventative measure.

It is preposterous to state that circumcision is a recommended procedure (let alone that it be encouraged) given the low risk that the average American male will have for any life threathening illness related to circumcision. If it were truly the aim of the CDC to prevent possible risk of life threatening illness with elective surgery at birth, then all female infants should be tested for the BRCA-1 gene. If BRCA-1 is present in the infant, it will have an approximately 50% chance of breast cancer over its lifetime (please note that this risk is orders of magnitude higher than the (alleged) risk of any life threatening illness being contracted by an uncircumcised male). This would be prevented with a double masectomy. Following the logic of the CDC in this document, a double masectomy would be highly encouraged for infants. Yet somehow, circumcision, which is only commonplace because of the lingering effects of quack science and puritanical anti-masturbation activists, is being encouraged by a governmental agency.

Finally, it is absolutely mind boggling that pediatricians recommend that circumcision be performed to reduce the risk of transmission of HPV. Given the already near-epidemic rates of HPV infection in the US, it is apparent that circumcision has not aided in preventing the transmission of anything.</td></tr><tr><td>313</td><td>Timothy Sally</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0313'>Permalink</a></td><td>We are living in an age when health and human rights are intimately intertwined, and the basic human rights of children are being increasingly recognized on the international level.

The first is <maybe> a lower risk of STDs, including HIV. So circumcised or not, people still need to be responsible and use a condom, so why also remove healthy tissue? The second is a reduced risk of UTIs in infant boys. It is true that intact infant boys have a slightly higher risk of UTIs than circumcised boys, but they still have a lower risk than infant girls. When babies (or adults) of either gender get a UTI, they get antibiotics and its taken care of, no big deal. The third "benefit" is that it might reduce the risk of a penile cancer (which is rare), but the American Cancer Society does not agree. So to me, these do not seem like very good "medical reasons" to surgically alter a baby. With this kind of reasoning, it would make much more sense to do mastectomies on infant girls to prevent breast cancer, but that would obviously be considered unethical. The CDC also failed to note the possible complications that can result from the procedure, including 100 deaths each year in the US, and the benefits of leaving a child intact (there are many). I expect better from our government than to recommend circumcision for these sort of reasons!</td></tr><tr><td>316</td><td>Toni Anonymous</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0316'>Permalink</a></td><td>As a first time mother to a 4 year old boy, I was faced with the decision to circumcise. I had a caring friend urge me to do my own research, and I am thankful I did. Boys would not be born with this covering of skin, if it were not for a purpose. The head of the penis is meant to be protected just like the clitoris is protected by a hood of skin.

We cannot allow this harmful procedure to continue; subjecting our newborn boys to a pain they shouldn't need to feel. It is very simple to teach cleanliness and using protection to prevent STI's and HIV while engaging in sexual intercourse. We would always take these precautions whether male or female and it should not be recommended for males to remove a necessary part of their genitalia to "perhaps" reduce the risk of infection. The number of urinary tract infections in a female is significantly higher than in a male whether intact or circumcised. Should we remove folds of skin in the vagina so that the likelihood of UTI's decreases? It does not make sense to remove something that a male was born with. If that were the reasoning, then should we reason to remove breast tissue from newborn females because the risk for breast cancer is in the hundred thousands?

If you want to recommend the removal of healthy tissue from the genitalia, then tests should be conducted in the United States. These tests done in Africa are in a country rampant with HIV already and it is grasping at straws to assume it's because of lack of circumcision. We live in an age where we have clean water, antibiotics, and the ability to keep our bodies healthy and protected. Can we not try these less invasive solutions instead? My son has never encountered a problem with his penis thus far and I presume he will not because we practice basic hygiene. My hope is that people in the United States will realize what a barbaric practice this is and that the majority of the rest of the world cannot be wrong when it comes to keeping their men intact. We don't see rampant cases of infections, HIV, etc. in other European countries, so what is to say we will find it here in the United States?

I know many mothers rely on the information provided by medical professionals who voice their opinions, but I hope that you can see how misleading the information in these studies can be and how it applies to our country. Please allow families to make an informed decision through education and not scare tactics about disease and "dirtiness." The foreskin is healthy, living tissue and any male deserves the right to consent to bodily modification when he is of consenting age. We as parents should not be allowed to make that decision for them.

I feel that a child should be allowed to keep their foreskin and it is not the place of a doctor to recommend that this right be taken away. There is already a trend away from this practice in America and such recommendations would have a negative impact on this shift. Such recommendations would undoubtedly cause more unnecessary circumcisions and leave many men (like myself) wishing that their parents had not taken their natural penis away from them. If anything, doctors should recommend that parents NOT get their child circumcised and list the benefits that a foreskin provides to parents who honestly might not know much about foreskins and might otherwise think that they are entirely useless, when, in actuality, they increase sexual pleasure and provide protection to the head of the penis, preventing chafing and desensitization. Listing the health benefits of circumcision honestly seems somewhat unnecessary, since most American parents are familiar with the supposed health benefits of circumcision but are ignorant to the function and advantages of the foreskin.

My son is intact. He had a urinary tract infection. We got medication and fixed it, just like I do for myself. If he happens to get cancer when he is older (less than 1% chance), we will treat that.

Male bodies are not defective and dirty. They are made perfectly. The foreskin has many well documented functions which are essential to normal male sexual function. It is the child's right to decide when/if he would want to give that up, in the absence of any true medical problem.

Once again as the CDC had done with their initial ebola recommendations it has concluded with inadequate or wrong recommendations or advice from inappropriately done studies that have a lot of statistics attached to them but have too many variables to make much conclusions from them. Blind sided by the statistics from theses studies and the inability of the people at the CDC to make the appropriate sense from them have led them to the wrong conclusion about circumcision and HIV. The ancient practice of circumcision is a drastic and inappropriate preventive treatment for HIV or any other STI as condom use is a much more reliable, cheaper and better method of prevention. Surgical removal of normal healthy tissue for the prevention of disease should always be use as a last resort and where there is overwhelming benefit to the patient, which is not the case here. The CDC needs to retract its recommendation or at least state condom use should be the preferred means of prevention of HIV not circumcision which will ultimately result in higher rates of disease from less stringent use of condoms in the circumcised population.

The two proven and accepted ways to prevent the sexual transmission of AIDS and other STD's is to abstain from having sex or to wear a condom while engaging in sex.

In recommending male circumcision for the prevention of the sexual transmission of disease is the CDC saying that this surgical treatment will attenuate the need for these or any other methods? No according to the CDC circumcised men must still engage in the exact same preventative measures that men with intact genitals must, namely abstinence and wearing condoms.

What the CDC is saying is that if a man has a 3" by 5" piece of flesh surgically removed from his genitals then his chances of contracting STD's are decreased by more than half. What are the mechanisms by which this protection is effected? The CDC says it doesn't know there are no medical or scientific research that demonstrates any actual, definitive process by which circumcision decreases the transmission of disease.

In the studies that the CDC has accumulated to support its recommendation is it clear that this protection was due to circumcision or was it actually due to subjects following the researchers' counsel and wearing condoms? Again, they don't know amazingly none of the studies the CDC references controlled for condom use nor for abstinence. Of course logic dictates that the circumcised groups of men had to engage in abstinence during a significant portion of the studies as they waited for the surgical wounds on their genitals to heal. As abstinence has been proven to be the most effective method for the prevention of sexual disease transmission maybe that's what accounted for the circumcised groups' lower rates of AIDS infection and not, as the CDC claims, the men's' lack of a foreskin?

Regardless of what the CDC claims and what the handful of studies they base it on purport to say, the hard data on a global level shows that the reality is the exact opposite. Apart from the United States and the southeast of Canada (and of course Israel) not one of the industrialized countries of the world practices male circumcision, and compared to each and every one of those countries the United States has a higher rate of nearly every sexually transmitted disease including AIDS. While it can be said that other factors such as differing levels of intravenous drug use could be contributing to the differing rates of AIDS, the total population numbers of these countries together numbering in the billions with only one significant sexual anatomical and physiological difference between them shows clearly that not only does male circumcision not lower AIDS and other STD's on the large scale level but that it in fact goes hand in hand with significantly higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases.

This fact bears repeating: Developed countries with no male circumcision have less AIDS, syphilis, herpes, human papillomavirus virus, etc. and the developed country with male circumcision has more sexually transmitted disease. In other words, the CDC's recommendation of male circumcision as a preventative measure against the sexual transmission of AIDS and any other sexually transmitted diseases has no external validity.

Clearly this recommendation is not based on science nor even basic logic; rather, it is the continued promotion of a jewish practice on the non-jewish population of America. All of the other industrialized countries on earth reject this race-based propaganda, and they are all healthier for it - the American people should reject it as well.</td></tr><tr><td>325</td><td>Randall Hauser</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0325'>Permalink</a></td><td>The CDC recommendation is outrageous.

At age 4, my intact Father had me circumcised for health reasons. The Muslim Doctor sold my Dad the flawed idea of a circumcised penis being cleaner. It is misrepresentation on the doctors part and my dad was foolish enough to believe him. A rational and sane person would not cut off body parts just for cleanliness.

Age 4. I was lured to the hospital by my parents. Before the operation, I sat on the hospital bed clearly in distress and crying, a nurse gave me a sweet yellow mixture of sedatives to suck on. The next thing I knew, I woke up in an unfamiliar environment, feeling pain in my privates. I pulled down my pant strap, horrified. My penis looked different. There was something attached to my penis, there was dull aching. I was scared, how was a 4 year old child supposed to react other than to cry? It was my penis, not some other body part. It was my penis.

Over the next few years, I was sold lies by my Father trying to justify his decision. I was confused. Why would I be born with a foreskin if it were not meant to be there? What if the boy did not appreciate getting circumcised and he had no say?

There was a turning point when I knew something was wrong. I was probably 7-8 years old at that time. Accompanied by my Mother, we were having a medical examination.
Asian Doctor: Have you undergone any operation before?
Mum: Shook her head.
Me: Circumcision! (Gleeful answering)
Doctor: Circumcision??? His eyes and mouth were wide open, with his eyebrows lifted.
He was astonished, in a state of disbelief. It was very awkward. Nothing else was said about the topic that day. I will never forget his expression. It was not something which I had expected.

For the next few years, I began researching the topic, coming across web pages which described the lost list, structures like the ridged band which cannot be replaced even with foreskin restoration. I lost interest in many of lifes daily activities. There is no means by which to quantify the state of metal trauma I have suffered because of circumcision. Growing up, I went to Asian schools where everyone I knew was intact. I had to constantly use stalls instead of urinals because I did not want people to see I was different. I was scared of public baths and showers because I was different. I had a physical defect.

Age 15, I started foreskin restoration via cross-taping, then moved on to T-taping, dual tension restorer, O-rings and the TLC Tugger.

I want a normal looking and working penis, and not hide in locker rooms anymore. Foreskin restoration has also made me feel that much more whole and more confident, like a real man. I have joined online support groups and signed petitions, donated money too.

Even though my parents in 1992 made what they believed to be the right decision, I still have not truly forgiven them. How can I? It is my body, MY FORESKIN. Neither my parents nor the Doctor had the right to decide to have the most erogenous part of my penis cut off. Where was my say in this? It is insanity! I feel robbed. I am robbed. Even till today, I experience nightmares about the experience. I have for countless times, woken up in the middle of the night, perspiring, crying alone in bed. The worst part was that I did not have a say in any of this, and neither did I want to get circumcised in the first place. It was not my choice.

I have recently confronted my parents and told them of how I feel. My Dad has apologized which has since given me some closure.

My Proposals
The patient must have the final say in the matter of whether to circumcise or not
The patient must be at least 18 years old
There must be no exceptions, even for religion. A child must have the sole rights over his body.
In the unfortunate event that an illegal circumcision is still carried out, the patient must have the rights to his hospital records so he can pursue legal action in the future. Doctors if found guilty of performing an illegal circumcision should be stripped of their license to practice.
The patient/parents must have informed consent, and know what is lost in the process of circumcision. They should watch videos on how a circumcision is performed so they know the anguish that they/their child will go through.
If a circumcision needs to be carried out for medical reasons, a foreskin friendly doctor must first be consulted regarding about any other treatment methods other than circumcision. The patient must be briefed and must fully understand what he is undergoing, what damage circumcision causes. A therapeutic circumcision must be the last resort to any treatment for ailments such as phimosis.

I hope that you give my proposals some thought. I am looking forward to the day where males are granted equal protection as females and circumcision of all kinds is finally outlawed.

There are large amounts of contrary evidence all over the web with real primary scientific studies and literature to go exactly against the statistics the CDC states exist.

However, I will not come here claiming to know information without citations. This information is widespread and easy for anyone to access. Instead, I am simply going to point out some logical fallacies based on simple logic.

For one, the idea that there is "not damage" done to a penis when you remove a large portion of skin (which is in fact mucous membrane lining the inside) that has fine touch receptors is ridiculous. Too add, the remaining portion of the penis dries out and becomes unnaturally covered in a type of callus. This hinders the normal function of the penis which is to stay moist and protected (which is evidenced on literally every single uncircumcised male world wide).

The double standard that this cannot be equivalent to female genital mutilation is also a complete logical fallacy. You are forcefully ripping and removing the healthy sexual tissue on newborn infants whom are clearly not consenting. Also, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize how severely painful this procedure must be for these little guys.

For over ten years it has been my life goal, literally my one and only life goal, to completely expose and stop male genital mutilation. I am less than a semester away from applying to Med school, and I'm coming to stop this gruesome and barbaric practice once and for all. As an M.D. or D.O. my life's work will be to expose this nonsense through multitudes of publications I will write against this mutilation and harnessing massive amounts of supporting doctors and others in the community.

There is nothing I am more passionate about then stopping male circumcision. It is literally the reason I chose to become an M.D. and have stuck it through to get there.

In other words this appears to be an attempt by medical professionals to cause fear, uncertainty and doubt in parents and adolescents for the purpose of implementing a misguided medical solution to a behavioral issue. The draft recalls the nineteenth century quackery of practitioners like John Harvey Kellogg who advocated radical efforts to prevent adolescent males from masturbating based on the false premise that masturbation damaged the individual's health.

I am more interested in why nature gave me the retractable hood in the first place. Cultural wisdom decided that it knew better than nature for my genitals. Maybe its right, but Ill never know if I dont know what I lost. So, why a retractable hood on a penis?

When I have had sex with women, I could not help notice that they had a retractable hood too. It made me wonder if this was connected somehow. If our mutually retractable outerlayers might be the point of first contact, would there be zero friction as they did their mutually retractable thing?

Without that little blessing from nature, my blunt, dull penis head cannot do the retraction dance, but just bores, burrows and prods its way to immortality. How charming. I have tried to compensate for its lack of a proper introductory retractable organ with lots of manual and oral salutations. Not complaining; thats nothing but fun.

My point is that advocates exclusively focus on why chop off the retractable hood, instead of why its there in the first place. I would like to hear a discussion of that.

And if it leads to the development of some satisfactory bionic replacement part, I would even argue for letting folks continue this barbaric Bronze Age practice.</td></tr><tr><td>339</td><td>victor khayat</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0339'>Permalink</a></td><td>I am a physician in the US and am shocked by the new CDC recommendation involving circumcising boys.

The barbaric practice of male circumcision is often perpetrated on helpless newborns, and is clearly done without their consent. I know: I was mutilated at birth, some 56 years ago, without my consent, because some doctor "counseled" my parents--including my uncircumcised father--that this violent butchery would somehow benefit my health. There is sufficient evidence that contradicts the current accepted beliefs in the US regarding any supposed benefits of circumcision. This evidence suggests that the amputation of a perfectly-healthy, completely-normal part of male physiognomy in a mass, one-size-fits-all scheme, not only does not have significant health benefits for the vast preponderance of its victims, but in fact actually does egregious harm to many of them physically, and perhaps most of them psychologically. The male foreskin has a vital function to protect the glans penis, and to violently rip--forever and unalterably--this precious organ from a screaming, strapped-down newborn can no longer be condoned in our society (as most other progressive, modern, Western nations have rejected this outdated practice). It is one thing for an informed adult man, upon serious reflection and the guidance of his doctor, to elect to have his foreskin surgically removed; it is entirely another thing to perform this atrocity on a non-consenting newborn. The CDC's proposal to advocate the continued routine mutilation of generations of healthy young Americans is totally irresponsible and it hints of an ulterior motive that is highly suspect.

The fact is that even if you are circumcised, you STILL HAVE TO WEAR A CONDOM to prevent the spread of HIV.... so what was the point to cutting off the foreskin? Circumcision conveys exactly ZERO benefit if you wear a condom... and NOT wearing a condom INCREASES the risk of spreading the disease... so you have just decreased the risk of transmitting HIV only if you choose to engage in a behavior that increases your risk of transmitting HIV. So do the numbers balance out? If you are circumcised, is the reduction in risk equal to or greater than the increase in risk of engaging in unprotected sex? Because if it is not, then you have just effectively INCREASED the risk factor of spreading HIV, not decreased it. The obvious answer to the spread of HIV is WEAR A CONDOM. The presence or absence of a foreskin has absolutely nothing to do with spreading the disease, and it is completely irresponsible to imply that it does. The fact that the U.S. has one of the highest rates of HIV among a population of mostly circumcised men makes your stance even more ludicrous.

HIV prevention aside, you are taking away the human right of bodily autonomy. Removing erogenous tissue from a non-consenting individual without clear medical need is a form of sexual assault. We don't allow this to be done to baby girls regardless of the "potential health benefits", it is equally unethical to do so to males. Considering the fact that this is soon to be addressed in court as unconstitutional, this puts the CDC in a very delicate position if they continue to promote this practice. It is illegal to circumcise females, males have the right to equal protection under the law. Do you really want to come down on the wrong side of that legal decision?

You really have to ask yourselves why you are so committed to promoting this practice when no other developed country in the world agrees with your position. Either you believe you possess information that the rest of the world is not privy to, or you are intentionally ignoring the overwhelming evidence that every other medical association in the world has that says this is not a healthy practice.

Circumcision is the same thing as Female Genital Mutilation and is wrong to perform on an unconsenting minor. If a consenting adult wishes to remove a part of their body they have that right, but an infant that is unable to consent should not have a part of their body removed, especially for the one and only reason of a very small reduction of risk of contracting an std (while having unprotected sex) later in life.

Even *IF* circumcision could reduce the chances of HIV transmission or other STDs, even 100%, it would still be unethical to remove normal, healthy body parts off babies. WHY? Because we don't remove any other parts from babies that are far more likely to cause infection/cancer/death later in life.

CONDOMS protect against HIV, STDs and unwanted pregnancy. EDUCATION helps people act responsibly.

I'd like to thank you in advance for taking two minutes to read and take this comment into consideration.

1. Not enough circumcision risks and side effects are clearly mentioned. We owe it to the parents to provide unbiased information for them to make an informed choice as circumcision clearly has both benefits and disadvantages. Many US/European based studies have found that circumcision may increase of risk of meatal stenosis, loss of sensitivity, erectile dysfunction, among other risks that should be clearly mentioned. If there's a risk shown in a US/European study, it should be revealed as this is not a light choice for parents and is a lifelong alteration to the child if circumcised. Anything else would result in a biased presentation of information and be unethical.

2. Uncircumcised boys and men and their families need not be harassed about this controversial topic just because they're as they were born. The topic of circumcision should only be discussed with parents when they make the decision for their newborn sons and in the event of a medical necessity later in life. Anything else is reminiscent to harassment and offers a false sense of security to circumcised males, which is reckless as that can increase the risk of HIV/STDs in itself. A better alternative would be to discuss the importance of using condoms with ALL sexually active males (especially teens), including information on how to obtain them as needed (county clinics for example). STD/HIV testing can also be discussed when relevant. Condoms, unlike circumcision, provide true universal protection against sexually transmitted STDs/HIV without offering a false sense of safety.

3. Have you PROVED that these African HIV studies are actually relevant in developed nations in North America and Europe? Have studies in developed nations (ie. USA/Canada, Japan, Europe, etc) actually shown a similar HIV/STD reduction due to circumcision? I ask this because there are huge differences between Africa and the USA. These studies were done in countries with HIV epidemics and that have poor water infrastructure (thus poor sanitation - likely worsened with their high humidity/heat environment and poor rates of condom usage). If this hasn't been proved, recommending circumcision is extremely wrong and unethical. One cannot simply assume that a study done in such a different environment will be the same in developed nations, especially when there have been STD studies showing no difference in STD transmission rates between circumcised and uncircumcised males. Also, keep in mind, that HIV rates in the USA are higher than other developed nations (which don't routinely circumcise). They're even higher than many mostly uncircumcised Latin America/Asia. Even within the USA, HIV rates among African Americans (who have high circumcision rates) are much higher than mostly uncircumcised Hispanics and Asians.

Overall, I find this very troubling. A much better alternative would be to discuss/promote the usage of condoms with all sexually active teens as it provides true protection to all (in addition to preventing unwanted pregnancies) without offering any false sense of security. Give them away for free at schools and doctors offices if needed. Additionally, something has to be done about the woefully inadequate HIV detection and treatment rates in this country.</td></tr><tr><td>370</td><td>Anonymous Anonymous</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0370'>Permalink</a></td><td>I am opposed to routine male circumcision as practiced here in the U.S. I believe it should be the choice of the child as an adult.

The long term damage done by steroid creams and continual foreskin stretching on so many young boys that are uncircumcised certainly create for a much higher risk of HIV or STDs with a female partner who may not be totally honest about her past. Condoms are not always available at the spur of the moment. Preaching about condom use and insisting on being clean at all times is great, but what when you dont have the luxury of being able to shower or bath 2-3 times a day to ensure you are always clean and ready? Realities of life dont always ensure you will be as fresh as a daisy all the time. There are comments posted by people who have no clue what life is like when things go wrong with a foreskin and the life long impact it can have. They would rather have that child suffer in pain for days to years than correct it with circumcision at the first signs of problems or do it as a preventative measure to begin with.

I believe the CDC statement should be strengthened to a recommendation. Science has shown real life saving results from circumcision without question. Its a parent's obligation to ensure they provide the best opportunities for their children to have a healthy, safe and prosperous life. No one can predict what situation your son will find himself in sexually at some point. When a bad situation arises, they need the best opportunity at protection at that time. That is the reality of life.

At minimum, parents should be informed of the life long and health benefits. Parents should be encouraged to look at all of science, not just what parts that fit their wants or support their cause. Life long includes addressing the later years in life when foreskins get to be much more troublesome especially when there are other health issues such as diabetes or when the man can no longer care for himself.

The older you are when getting circumcised, there is way more pain, the outcome is aesthetically not as pleasing and the sexual pleasure may not be there as its a mindset that could prevent that too, but not always. Infant circumcision alleviates many of these future problems. The perpetual references to loss of 20000 nerve receptors is only found on intactivist websites implying that only the foreskin has any feeling. Again a factless statement unproved by the fact that over 80% of American men, who are all circumcised enjoy a great sex life and so do their partners. US history and facts speak volumes on benefits alone.

While social and religious influence has been there for many years, they cant all be wrong. Hopefully with a recommendation, Medicaid can be reinstated to pay for infant circumcision in the 18 states that is currently is not paid in ultimately saving the American government and tax payers a lot of money over future medical expenses stemming from not being circumcised as an infant and giving access to many parents that otherwise are being penalized by not being able to afford to circumcise their sons. They could be the demographic group that needs it the most. America as a nation was most prosperous country in the world starting right after WWII when circumcision rates were high and continued as such into the early 1980s at a very high rate. As the circumcision rate has declined over the years, so has the US as the leading country in the world.

Thank you for providing the American public with a long overdue opportunity to learn that we have been fed hype, myths, and misinformation about the "problems" of an intact male foreskin. (Girls have one too you know- can you imagine the ruckus raised if you were to recommended we excise that?)

Why in the world would any teenage boy or adult male lucky enough to have been left with intact genitals, opt to amputate what they already know is the most sensitive and pleasurable skin on their bodies- especially in light of the fact that they will still have to use condoms and employ safe sex practices, which by themselves are almost 100% effective in guarding against HIV and STD's? I assume the CDC guidelines will include an insistence that doctors tell them that? And will you also tell them that condom use will become even more difficult as the denuded glans becomes desensitized?

So far I see comments on this site running almost100% against your outrageous proposal. Will you take that to heart and retract this outrageous suggestion? Sadly, I believe it may possibly still go through. In that event, I have the following information to add to your recommendations to doctors:

For prospective parents:

Please tell them that:

At birth and for some time after, the foreskin is fused to the glans forming a "sterile package," protecting the delicate skin of the glans from injury and foreign substances. This will retract on its own over time, usually just about when a boy is old enough to be taught to keep himself clean. (Isn't Nature brilliant?)

Newborns feel pain and genital cutting (let's call it what it is) is excruciating. Especially, since first the fused foreskin needs to be ripped from the glans. Even if they don't consciously remember the pain, the body will.

The foreskin is NOT a defect. Removing it results in the loss of 10-20K fine touch nerve en
dings, the frenulum (the French - who are luckily mostly intact-call it the "love nerve")- the ridged band, movable sleeve, lubrication, etc........,,

Routine infant genital cutting violates every principle of of surgery on non-consenting minors: It is of NO immediate benefit; it DOES do harm, it is way out of PROPORTION to any purported benefit- far less invasive are good hygiene, antibiotics, HIV vaccines, condoms, and it is UNJUST, since baby girls are protected in this country from even a pinprick to their genitals.
Infantile genital cutting is dangerous- 117 infants deaths per year are directly caused by it, not to mention all the deaths due to "hemmorage ," "sepsis," and "respiratory failure" to which other actual circumcision deaths are attributed.

And, in general- please present accurate facts:

When you say "lessens incidence of penile cancer" - will you tell people that the actual rate of penile cancer in the general population is 1 in 100,000 and that the rate in Israel (with almost 100% circumcised males) and Sweden (with 89-90% intact males) is just about equal? Will you please tell them that. You are misleading the public with this incomplete information. I would expect more from the CDC!

Will you tell them that the "African Studies," even without their much discussed flaws, are not relevant to American males? More relevant is the "natural experiment" and existing statistics in Europe, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc. - where 80-90% of males are intact and, if anything, have lower rates of HIV and STD's? If you are going to ask boys and men to make this radical decision, shouldn't they have All the facts?

There is so much more to say. CDC- please take note- the American public is no longer in the dark. We will not be duped. Factual information is finally available. Routine Genital cutting, is a barbaric, primitive, unsupportable practice. Help babies, boys and men stay whole, the way Nature intended. Teach them good health and hygienic practices, help them have healthy attitudes towards sex, and then you will truly be doing your job!!!! You can't hold back an idea whose time has come, no matter how hard you try. Please, put your energies where they can really do some good. Dont make us the laughing stock of the developed world.</td></tr><tr><td>381</td><td>Anonymous Anonymous</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0381'>Permalink</a></td><td>I caution against adopting the Recommendations for Providers in the current form.

At its core, the Recommendations use data from studies in Africa to show health benefits of circumcision. This is a fundamentally flawed basis, at least as it relates to sexually transmitted infections, HIV, etc., because the usage patterns of condoms and other protections against sexual diseases are significantly different in those countries than they are in the United States.

These Recommendations should be based on statistics appropriate for American males. Any evaluation of risk of disease must accordingly be in relation to a U.S. baseline; to recommend permanent surgery, it is not enough that circumcision reduces risk in an absolute sense, but it must substantially reduce risk among a population with typical American condom usage. After all, condoms remain the preferred method of protection from disease, and are generally very effective. It is not sensible to recommend surgery based on minimal change in risk; the CDC admits that the necessary data is not available for American males. Why, then, is a recommendation made at all?

Because of the relative rarity of HIV and other diseases mentioned in the Recommendations, and the minimal nature of some of them, non-medical effects of circumcision tend to weigh far stronger in males' lives. Aesthetic, religious, social, etc. preferences will tend to be more important. Accordingly, the recommendation of circumcision based on health benefits by providers to parents to who do not request information is inappropriate; the provider interferes with the parents' non-medical considerations and pressures them (by weight of a physician's authority) into a decision.

The use of vague terms like "reduce risk" is also inappropriate in recommendations to parents. Reductions or increases in risk may not be substantial; this is an evaluation each parent needs to make for themselves. Accordingly, all mentions of change in risk should use real numbers, like those found in the Box, so as to prevent misconceptions.

The CDC should strongly revise the Recommendations to be less misleading, and if no data is available to make it less so, advise physicians about the lack of data in the field as it pertains to American male.s</td></tr><tr><td>382</td><td>Kristin Hoye</td><td>Dec 5, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0382'>Permalink</a></td><td>As a first generation U.S. born woman of Norwegian parentage I feel compelled to comment on the claim that male circumcision can prevent the transmission of AIDS and other STDs. Ethnic Europeans have never circumcised; it is not a part of their culture.

The U.S. has more AIDS than other industrialized countries and the highest rate of circumcision among sexually active males. So even our own statistics here at home counter the notion that circumcision lowers the incidence of AIDS.

We should not look to Africa on this issue. We do not live like Africans; we live much more like Europeans. What is going on in Europe with regard to AIDS is much more relevant for us than anything happening in Africa.

The call for submissions is being done over the Christmas / Holiday season. The draft guidelines, and notification calling for comment, assert that "studies" support male genital mutilation, but do not cite those studies. How then is anyone meant to critique those studies, such as the methodological weakness and flaws in such studies, leaving alone the sociological bias inherent in both the basis for such studies and the conclusion drawn from them. People are required to request information about which studies are being cited, and the delays in responses from CDC tick down the time available to make a response. Is the CDC really answering questions over the Christmas - New Year week?

The studies are cited as the basis for advice to medical practitioners. But for example, double mastectomy prevents incidents of breast cancer, so would CDC ever allow this to be used as advice to support the removal of breast tissue from young girls and infants? The social biases of the CDC are on show.

The guidelines supposedly focus on advice to medical practitioners abound "elective circumcision for adults" but incidentally add the guidelines are for use in advising "parents" as well. The guidelines have unnecessarily conflated the two issues. Of course all male adults in the United States have the right to surgically alter their genitals, and deserve accurate summation of current data on health benefits and risk of such procedures. But it is another issue entirely when considering the authorisation of genital mutilation by parents of infant children. For a start the costs and benefits are not outlined in the draft guidelines. There is o discussion of absolute numbers or incidence to give a sense of perspective. For example, of one million foreskin excisions of infants in 2014, how many fewer cases of HIV does the CDC expect? What is is the psychological impact on those million boys and men over their lifetimes. Does the CDC support the prioritisation of STD risk reduction over the damage done to male mental health and psychological wellbeing.

I don't see Asian men who are virtually never cut or European men who are only cut at about the 3% level keeling over while clutching their genital because they are so disease ridden from not being cut that they are dying like flies. This vile practice has gone on for way too long in America and has been falsely claimed to cure crippled legs, insanity, TB, Syphilis, Epilepsy,and now seem to be touted and some sort of AIDS proofing men and stopping them from getting or transmitting aids through anal intercourse or other STD's. Now only about 3% of the population of men is homosexuals and are assumed to all be practicing sodomy which is not practiced by all homosexual men. Condoms stop transmission of disease by all males regardless of their sexual practices or preferences, not amputating 50% of penile skin, as if amputation of the foreskin provides some sort of vaccine protection. Any doctor without his brain being infected with this nonsense knows full well circumcision does little or nothing to prevent spread of disease otherwise Europe and Asian men would be dying like flies with grossly infected penises, which is not the case. In fact the US with about a 70% circumcision rate has the highest AIDS infection rate along with Israel and Muslim countries who all practice this penis reducing surgery, so circumcision apparently makes matters worse. Also several infants die from this unnecessary procedure each year, which some say is insignificant, unless of course it is YOUR child that dies from this unnecessary procedure. If these unnecessary circumcisions had not been performed these boys would be grown up, and alive,and God forbid, with complete penises as they were born with, I find members of religious groups that practice this seem to think they are so correct that they must impose this practice on everyone to somehow protect us from ourselves ,which in my opinion is pure nonsense . Amputation of the foreskin removes most of the most sensitive parts of the penis and removes the protection of the glans. This is causes less enjoyable sex for the man and often causes problems for the female caused by excessive friction from the dried out denuded male penis. Another thing I find appalling is that the amputated male infant foreskins are used to make beauty potions marketed to women. I learned that while watching the politically correct OPRA show. I was stunned as the female guest giggled gleefully about this fact. I wonder if they would giggle gleefully if their beauty potions were made form amputate infant female labia?? After all those female labia may retain some drops of urine as a foreskin may so we must amputate that labia too. I think not!!! Medical societies in Canada and in Europe absolutely do not condone foreskin removal performed on infant boys and some actually condemn it. Stop this amputation of men's foreskins and stop funding it with insurance and tax dollars as it makes it purely an incentive for the medical profession to promote this vile practice for their own profit.</td></tr><tr><td>399</td><td>Anonymous Anonymous</td><td>Dec 8, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0399'>Permalink</a></td><td>Basically, the CDC is trying to make drug and medical equipment reps out of physicians and mid-level providers in regards to circumcision. What the CDC is doing in the U.S. seems to be laying the groundwork for a larger public information campaign extolling the benefits of being circumcised; similar to ones seen in African third-world countries (where HIV transmission is primarily heterosexual). I don't think that it would be irrational to predict that the CDC and other agencies/organizations will produce ads similar to those currently produced by pharmaceutical companies: "Are you straight? Do you have unprotected sex with lots of women? Ask YOUR doctor about circumcision." And of course, the fast-talking disclaimers will also be included, but glossed over with sappy scenes of love and blissfulness between a young heterosexual couple: "individual results may vary." "circumcision alone does not protect against HIV and other STDs" "Always use condoms as directed."

Putting circumcision front and center in an HIV prevention campaign is unethical, since alternatives (ie- abstinence, regular/proper use of condoms and choosing partners wisely) are much more effective at preventing HIV transmission. And when asked about the alternatives to circumcision in the context of HIV/STD prevention, doctors will be "encouraged" to say something similar to the famous words near and dear to the hearts of every drug and equipment rep: "I can only speak to the on-label recommendations published by the CDC."

Instead of putting circumcision in the spotlight as a means of primary prevention, why can't the CDC ramp up efforts at *comprehensive* sex education and condom use- interventions that are much more effective at prevention the spread of HIV and STDs.

I'm quite positive that the biomedical companies who make skin grafts out of infant foreskins will find the CDC's pro-circumcision public information campaign quite convenient. The campaign is basically a 100% neat/clean way for these companies to increase their supply of a raw material (foreskin) that is exponentially more cost-effective and productive compared to cadaver skin and other sources; especially when the overall rate of circumcision in the U.S. has dropped.</td></tr><tr><td>400</td><td>Paul Graham</td><td>Dec 8, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0400'>Permalink</a></td><td>Amazing that the CDC is evidently staffed by people who are as culturally biased as they are incapable of reading and understanding the scientific nuances of studies.

The shaft of the penis is an internal organ. The foreskin is required to keep the penis moist, to keep outside dirt out, & to provide pleasure for the man & his partner(s). The foreskin is no different than an eyelid or a fingernail. It is part of the human body for a reason. It is meant to be there.

It is a human rights violation to perform this surgery upon a person without their permission. Is it allowable to take a woman, strap her to a table, & cut off her genital skin? No. So why is it acceptable to do that to a man? Where is your research to medically support the same statement about HIV/AIDS & circumcision in terms of the female anatomy? You dont have one. Why? Because the Western World would be up in arms. But you cant have it both ways, you absolutely cannot.

Why is it acceptable that Americans are being encouraged to can perform major surgery upon an infant for aesthetic & superficial reasons (for example, I want him to look like other boys, The foreskin is ugly); but that same child is not allowed to drive or vote until they are over the age of 15? Doesnt he deserve a voice, a choice? When he is of the age to drive, then he should be allowed to seek out medical care to get circumcised.

If a teenager was disabled from severe birth defects; if an elderly man was in a Care Facility because of dementia or Alzheimers; if a grown man was hospitalized but unable to speak, write, or communicate is it ethical to strap these men down to a table & perform circumcision without their permission. No. In fact, you would be subject to Litigation for performing surgery on a man without his permission. So why is it ethical to perform circumcision on a newborn child? Because he cannot read or write? Just because hes new that means he doesnt have rights? It is simply not justified. You need to realize that the blood-curdling shrieking & crying from that infant at the time of surgery is a cry for help. That is a human being in a state of physical abuse & pain. The medical community has a responsibility to look out for the well-being of its patients, not to exploit them because well, thats what everybody else is doing.

The removal of the foreskin is equivalent to slicing off an eyelid or ripping off fingernails. It is a brutal process. Doctors are irresponsible if performing this surgery: without asking for permission from the parents first an; strapping down the infant & cutting it; the baby suffers immense pain; there is known neurological & heart damage to the infant from the stress & pain of the surgery; he will lose permanent nerve damage at the area; will be guaranteed to have less pleasure sexually as an adult, as will his partners; & most importantly, the occurrences of botched surgeries & death are rampant. More than zero (0) deaths is unacceptable. No child should die from a cosmetic surgery that he did not ask for, that he had zero choice in being performed upon him, & that has a chance of killing him.

The foreskin is fused to the shaft because, like the infant brain, it has not finished development. It is not until approx. age 3 or 4 before the foreskin should ever be retracted on the penis. When you forcefully retract or remove the foreskin prior to its natural stage of development, you are slicing off highly sensitive skin & nerve endings that are fused to the sex organ.

Circumcision in communities riddled with AIDS/HIV has nothing to do with the general population of the US. The CDC must be aware that if they put such a careless claim out that circumcision is safe & recommended, they will influence the behavior of North American communities where AIDS/HIV is not a widespread problem. You will be influencing & reinforcing the unnecessary practice that the US, the only Western Civilized Nation on Earth where routine, non-religious, non-medically needed male genital circumcision is performed. It makes no sense!

It is a known fact that the foreskin of circumcised American males is being farmed & sold by hospitals to pharmaceutical companies to be used in facial cream & moisturizers. In other words, there is a corrupt reason for the Medical Community to endorse circumcision. Because they can make a fortune from it.

When most of Europe has banned or has very specific guidelines about circumcision, it is the responsibility of the CDC to learn from them, read their research, talk to them, watch the videos of infants being circumcised, & question why there is a sexist (misandry) bias in America where we are justified in cutting the genitals of males & not females, against their will.

Questionable benefits are listed specifically while known risks are mentioned vaguely and neither are presented objectively. As just one example it isnt clear that, within the the CDC fact sheet, the 0.5% of newborns with adverse effects equates to 5000 adverse events/yr, and that that number far exceeds the number of people who would purportedly benefit (using numbers from 2010 [http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/basics/ataglance.html] given that the highest risk group, MSMs, are excluded from the claimed benefit of circumcision.

This lack of clarity is an effect of listing potential health benefits, in the Health Benefits section, in terms of RELATIVE changes in risk, while in the Health Risks section, stating risks in ABSOLUTE percentages of the population. Even if you believe the presented numbers to be accurate, this discrepancy in reporting method is a well-known tactic that is misleading and misrepresents comparative risks, making it clear that the CDC is trying to sell their recommendation rather than to educate the public so that they can take part in the debate. Use of natural frequencies instead would be more honest.

It is also misleading to report the reduction in the incidence of male infant urinary tract infection as a benefit to circumcision when the correlation of UTIs with uncircumcised infants is known to be caused by improper care of the childs penis by the mother. A more appropriate remedy for that would be proper education of the parents and not alteration of the penis. This is important because UTI prevention is the ONLY listed issue that would benefit from taking action before the child is old enough to consent. But even then, the benefits of the procedure would not outweigh the potential harm, with UTI risk then being the only benefit of such early action.

And while only one sentence acknowledges that delaying circumcision until adolescence or adulthood enables the male to participate in -- or make -- the decision, even this wording implies the decision will be made to circumcise, but it might be nice (a mere courtesy!) if he could be a part of it. No consideration is given to the benefit of not removing the most sensitive skin of the penis. No consideration is given to the harm of having the decision perhaps not turn out to be what he would have chosen for himself.

Even if the benefits were to be accepted (and the clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa were by no means perfectly executed, nor would the cultural differences regarding sex that make it so rampant there translate to similar incidence reduction in the US), at most they may rationally lead to the recommendation that circumcision should be considered by an individual when hes old enough to make that decision, not that it should be performed non-consensually on children. Children arent their parents property. Your CDC factsheet states flat out that Male circumcision is a voluntary procedure and then you recommend that it be done to infants that cant consent. This drafts position conflates the best interests of the child with the wishes of the parents.

Given that many countries where most males are left intact have much lower rates of HIV incidence, it should be clear there are other areas that can be addressed, besides recommending physical mutilation, that can have the desired effect.

But if the CDC will recommend that parents be informed of the benefits of circumcision, then parents must also be informed that none of the benefits will affect the child before he is old enough to take part in the decision, that the foreskin performs real physiologic functions, that many men are angry and resentful that theyve been irreversibly surgically altered and that there is a risk that their son may feel similarly.</td></tr><tr><td>409</td><td>Anonymous Anonymous</td><td>Dec 8, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0409'>Permalink</a></td><td>It would behoove our government to take notice of the strong evidence against routine infant circumcision--and medically unnecessary adult circumcision as well--especially after the European medical community's recent denunciation of it.

Infant circumcision is the easiest time to use circumcision for the secretive benefits as population control. religious and racial hygiene, and ethnic cleansing, by simply cutting out the frenulum delta and excessive shaft skin, without the knowledge of the child or parents, and gives an unfair advantage to religious extremist/fanatics working in the medical industry. Depending on how the circumciser was taught to perform his/her craft, he/she now has the power over the man as an infant to cause him little to great sexual dysfunctions to develop after puberty without his or his parents knowledge. The CDC has omitted and disregarded the neurological functions of both sexes prepuces to cause and send sexual arousal signals to the reproductive parts of our brains when physically stimulated.

The AAP recognizes that the American Psychological Associations have shown that the sexual trauma, shock, molestation, and mutilation involved during infant rapes and circumcision has been linked to causing catatonic shock, coma, and amnesia which can resurface after puberty as delayed onset PTSD, and diagnosed as schizoaffective disorders. Now the AAP recommends pain killer/anesthesia during routine infant circumcision to avoid the PTSD symptoms, but have increased the rates of autism by using these dangerous drugs in infancy.

Much like any other unnecessary and destructive genital modification, circumcision should only be performed on consenting adults who have reached the age of majority, are fully informed of the dangers and permanency of the operation, and have undergone the requisite mental health evaluation.

Both parents and physicians are duty bound to act in the best interests of the child, without regard to their own will.
So when it comes to any permanent and destructive operation on a child there is no choice to be made. If it can at all be avoided or put off to a later time, then it must be. The least destructive path is the only valid one.

Outside of the flawed African studies the CDC cites as a basis for its stance, circumcision has never been shown to prevent or reduce HIV transmission. Likewise for other STIs. As the Royal Dutch Medical Association (KNMG) noted in their rebuttal to the AAP's recent statement on circumcision, the United States has the highest rate of HIV and STIs in the developed world despite (or because of) the fact that the US also has the highest rate of circumcision. If there were any benefits at all to circumcision, one would expect to see that in the US after generations of near-universal circumcision. Instead, we see just the opposite.

Likewise for Africa. In 10 of the 18 countries surveyed in which circumcision is the most common, HIV rates are also the highest. In only 4 countries do we see a slight decrease in HIV rates accompanying circumcision, while in 4 others HIV rates are essentially the same between circumcised and intact populations. Indeed, the latest news from Africa reveals huge spikes in HIV transmission in many of the areas that have been the target of pro-circumcision campaigns. Part of the problem is that men mistakenly believe that circumcision makes them "immune" from disease. But another, so far unacknowledged possibility, is that circumcision itself may not have any of the preventative qualities that promoters say.

Any objective look at the data reveals that the alleged benefits of circumcision are over-stated at best. Meanwhile, no thorough investigation into the risks, harms, and negative consequences of circumcision has ever been done.

As such, it is entirely unjustifiable to recommend circumcision as a disease prevention tool. Doctors have no basis for advising intact males to be circumcised according to the available research.</td></tr><tr><td>427</td><td>David Sokal</td><td>Dec 8, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0427'>Permalink</a></td><td>As a medical epidemiologist, initially trained in pediatrics, who has helped conduct trials of new surgical techniques of adult male circumcision in Africa, I agree with the 2012 assessment of the American Academy of Pediatrics that the benefits of neonatal circumcision outweigh the risks.

The fact remains that there is not a single alleged heath benefit to MGM that could not be achieved through the simple practice of washing, the use of antibiotics in the relatively rare cases of UTIs, and through the use of condoms to protect against the transmission of HIV and other STDs. Indeed, even these new proposed CDC guidelines do not claim that MGM will do anything to reduce a woman's risk of contracting HIV from a circumcised, HIV+ male so, to the extent that these guidelines will foster the mistaken belief that people do not need to use condoms, they are just as likely to lead indirectly to increased rates of STDs and HIV.

Of course, aside from the purely epidemiological question is the ethical question of imposing a permanent amputation of a healthy, functional, sensitive body part without the victim's consent when less invasive alternatives are available (the foreskin has thousands of nerve endings, and it also provides protection for the glans and lubrication during intercourse). After all, there are many surgical procedures that could be performed which would reduce the incidence of this or that disease, but that does that make such procedures ethical. For example, we could effectively wipe out breast cancer in the U.S. tomorrow if every adolescent girl and woman underwent prophylactic bilateral radical mastectomy. It's not as if breast tissue is "needed" any more than the foreskin is. And there are perfectly suitable alternatives to breast milk. Is the CDC going to recommend universal prophylactic radical mastectomies as well? One would certainly hope not. Yet, as barbaric and preposterous as that would be, the CDC's proposed recommendations in support of forced infant male genital mutilation is in no significant way any different.

There is not a single professional medical organization on Earth that endorses infant male genital mutilation. In this respect, and to the shame of the CDC and the U.S.A., the United States is an outlier. Even the American Association of Pediatricians stops short of actually recommending MGM (although they still assert that the benefits outweigh the risks) because it remains medically unnecessary (since there are conservative alternatives available) and thus falls back on the recommendation that the decision be based ultimately on "cultural" and "religious" considerations. Of course, cultural and religious considerations are exactly what are used to justify female genital mutilation.

One would have thought that if the U.S. stands for anything, it stands for the principle of human rights. And one would have that that, by extension, any arm of the U.S. government, such as the CDC, would base its recommendations not only on the science - which absolutely DOES NOT support routine forced male circumcision - but on medical ethics, as well. Forced infant male circumcision has been condemned roundly throughout the civilized world and by none other than the United Nations.

A scientific trial requires the same treatment of all participants in the trial; this was not the case in these trials. When the control group is not given the same information and materials as the trial group, the trial is flawed.
An anecdotal study comparing circumcision rates and HIV infection around the world indicates that if there is any correlation it is that countries with higher circumcision rates have a higher incidence of HIV infection.

I very much doubt that Europe has a higher rate of STI's than the United States. Im currently learning Japanese, and plan to travel and live there someday. The vast majority of the population is not circumcised, and bathing is rather public.

I am also in the process of restoring my foreskin, primarily because I dislike that the choice was taken from me at birth. There are no health benefits to circumcision unless Im sleeping around without condoms, which I dont do. When I do become sexually active, it will be safe sex and we will both be tested. I find the CDCs recommendation to be a load of garbage. Babies are not sexually active, and the history of circumcision began with the misguided notion that it would result in less sex, less unwanted pregnancy, and less health complications. There are more psychological and physical complications that arise from circumcision than leaving things be.

Male circumcision for me is the exact same thing as female genital mutilation. You take something from someone when you cut off part of their body without consent. Imagine if some organization claimed that cutting off your pinkie toes was beneficial to your health and preventing athletes foot. It is not right to force babies, who are innocent and have no sexual risks, to undergo a surgery to take away sensitive tissue and re-make the function of the penis.

All those are important opinions. However, the most important issue regarding circumcision for me, and the fact that I was sliced as an infant, is that I did not consent to it. The government should not be supporting policy that takes away someone's right to choose what happens to their body. I did not appreciate being cut, and restoring my foreskin is a very long process that does not completely make things right. So make things right by other men by discarding the misguided notion that cutting off body parts prevents disease. Safe sex prevents disease a lot better than cutting off part of someone's body.

Please discard the CDCs recommendation and do whats right for men. Leave us intact.

Yes, it is the extreme pain and trauma for a newborn due to unjustified reasons. To strap a baby to a board, spread-eagle, and slice off the tip of his penis without an analgesic is brutal and barbaric. Then the gauze sticks to the wound and the urine stings. It is not just!
The recommendations to circumcise were based on 3 studies done in Africa ten years ago. The studies showed that uncircumcised men were more likely to contract HIV from their HIV+ wives than circumcised men from their HIV+ wives. So,
1) Babies don't have to worry about getting an STD for over a decade.
2) Condoms help prevent the spread of STDs.
3) Africa has a much higher % of AIDS than the US.
4) Most people in the US have access to warm running water and soap.
5) There are now men in Africa getting circumcisions so that they don't have to use condoms. (My guess is that condoms are
safer against STDs than circumcisions.)
Back to the babies... I believe that we have evolved and are born in perfect form, for reasons that we may not fully understand, and as God created us. I understand that a father or mother may want their son to look like their father, but it is not a legitimate reason to circumcise. If it is truly to decrease the risk of an STD, the baby boy should make the decision when he is old enough to understand the implications.
Many countries have a low rate of circumcision, Europe, Canada, South America, Japan, China, Russia, Australia and New Zealand. Jews and Muslims have a high rate of circumcision.

Brian Earp of the University of Oxford was right in his assessment,
"The CDC is using the wrong formulation for assessing the prudence of circumcision, namely benefit vs. risk. Benefit vs. risk was designed for therapeutic procedures (sometimes referred to as "medically necessary" surgeries), where it must be shown that the benefits to the patient outweigh the risk of surgical complications. In the case of circumcision performed on healthy individuals who cannot - if they are minors - consent, however, the appropriate test is not benefit vs. risk, but rather benefit vs. harm. Here, "harm" includes not only the risk of surgical complications (an elusive figure, due to the poor quality of the existing data), but also the inherent harm of having a functional, erotogenic genital structure removed in the absence of either disease or deformity."

Non-therapeutic circumcision needs to be left in the uneducated era where it originated.

As a healthcare professional and a critical reader of scientific studies, I find your evidence for this recommendation lacking. I have noted that most of your research comes from Africa - where basic human needs go unmet daily, and where nutrition, hygiene, and general health education are inadequate at best. It would seem more prudent to evaluate data from developed nations with similar health performance to the United States before making recommendations for our sons. In fact, looking at nations with health performance that exceeds our own may offer even better evidence to the prevention of disease. Further, you may choose to compare the incidence of HIV in developed nations with the incidence of routine infant circumcision. Infant boys are not routinely circumcised throughout Europe, Australia, Asia, and Latin America - yet our HIV infection rate exceeds those of most of these regions. (Per the CIA World Factbook, 2011).

A leap to the recommendation for a surgical procedure (that is not without risks) to prevent a potential disease is outrageous. Transmission of HIV and other STIs could be better managed by improving sexual education and access to medical care and contraception/STI prevention. Again, it may be prudent to confer with other developed nations (whose HIV/STI infections are lower than ours) and build your recommendations from there.

Lastly, an anecdote: I have a family history of both kidney and colon cancer. Statistically, I have a higher risk of developing these diseases than either HIV or any STI. Yet at no time has any doctor recommended I prophylactically have a nephrectomy or colectomy to prevent them. Instead, I have been counseled on risk factors and lifestyle changes that can reduce my risk. Why, then, would you recommend circumcision for HIV/STI prevention?

There is no logic in amputating any part of the whole body which is functional (something circumcision proponents hide for the organ "prepuce") to prevent probable disease in the future. Even if it was proved by actual microscopic pictures that HIV can be 100% prevented by removing foreskin, still it would not be logical for the reason stated above. In Africa, people also get HIV from non-sterile medical facilities and injection drug use etc. which will go on and flawed trials could not prove effectiveness in case of MSM, so there will continue to be lots of HIV. Coming to the trials itself, the manipulated data and reprehensible misunderstanding of the glorious discipline of statistics are giving a pseudo legitimacy to the conclusion. Muslim, conservative North African countries with less casual sex habits and prostitutes and the fact that HIV reached there later have lower HIV prevalence than sub-Saharan countries, the reason was evident yet used as an excuse to conduct the trials. Although in many of the sub-Saharan countries there is higher HIV incidence among cut men (this fact should have disqualified and disallowed the trials.
Due to lack of double blinding, attrition (logically when a cut man finds out he got infected despite going through everything, he is likely to drop out and number of drop outs were many times that of seroconverters), not investigating other methods of infection (even when some men reported no unprotected sex turned seroconverted), lead-time bias (cut men did not have sex for 2 months from the start), extra counselling for cut men, using ELISA (with 90 days window) instead of DNA-PCR means that some might have been positive at the start and disproportionately, the circumcised group who turn positive over time would have been deemed as false negatives especially when the studies seem to be sinisterly terminated early.
Even after all this, the study seemed to show a small absolute reduction of 1.3% and relative incidence was hyped and promoted as 60% because the absolute would be considered inconsequential and average people's (especially Americans') lower understanding of Statistics.
Finally, these studies, clearly set in a completely different set of parameters (like prevalence, education etc.) could never be valid for US or any developed country. However, while the understanding holds good across the world, US is moving the other way and may be this has to do with possible circumcision ban for children being considered in Europe at this time.

Most European countries with low rates of circumcision (aka: male genital mutilation) do not show high rates of these same diseases, therefore, it seems that the conclusions drawn by the task force members reveal cultural bias.

"The cardinal medical question should not be whether circumcision can prevent disease, but how disease can best be prevented. (Frisch, MD, PhD, et al)"

Behavioral factors are far more important in mitigating harm from HIV and STIs. Using condoms is an already proven method of preventing such diseases and far less injurious and invasive than such an abhorrent and what many see as an outdated, barbaric procedure based primarily upon unfounded fears; especially when you consider that this invasive, surgical procedure is performed on the most helpless, vulnerable and in our country--indeed, those who cannot speak for themselves: infant boys.

"For American society, circumcision is a solution in search of a problem, a social custom disguised as a medical issue. Beware of culturally-biased studies on circumcision posing as science, and take your whole baby home. (Circumcision Research Center)"

'American pro-circumcision researchers have found dozens of "benefits," from treating epilepsy and masturbation in the late 1800s to preventing sexually transmitted diseases today. Though such claims generally do not withstand scrutiny by medical policy committees, their continued publication over the years has led to medical myths while raising questions about some researchers' motives. American researchers tend to avoid studying or acknowledging the sexual and psychological harm associated with circumcision. This pro-circumcision bias in American medicine reflects the pro-circumcision bias in American culture. The United States is the only country in the world that circumcises some of its male infants for non-religious reasons. When Europeans learn about this, they think we're crazy. (Circumcision Research Center)'

Just because something terrible has been done to baby boys (without their consent) over generations by a culture, does not make it the right thing to continue to do. Searching for reasons to support routine male genital mutilation is not what we should be doing to support the health (sexual and otherwise) of our teen boys--appropriate sexual education, including condom use is. If a boy gets a rare UTI or other disease, they are treatable with drugs we currently have.

A large cohort study in May 2013 by Bronselaer GA, et al, "confirms the importance of the foreskin for penile sensitivity, overall sexual satisfaction, and penile functioning. Furthermore, this study shows that a higher percentage of circumcised men experience discomfort or pain and unusual sensations as compared with the uncircumcised population. Before circumcision without medical indication, adult men, and parents considering circumcision of their sons, should be informed of the importance of the foreskin in male sexuality."

This endorsement of male circumcision for health reasons by the CDC is ludicrous, given the overwhelming evidence against such a policy.

I hope that clearer heads will prevail in the future and that recommendations will be based on more sound studies and common sense, that apparently the rest of the world has in higher abundance.

Male circumcision is akin to female genital mutilation and neither should not be inflicted on or pressured upon anyone who is not an independent, rational adult. These are not practices the CDC should be trying to increase. Rather, education, hygiene, dissemination of condoms, etc. is a far more appropriate way to deal with disease prevention.</td></tr><tr><td>454</td><td>Roland Hulme</td><td>Dec 8, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0454'>Permalink</a></td><td>In specific rebuttal to these recommendations, I'd like to point out several things,
starting with the fact that this report massively under-reports complications from
circumcision.

Circumcision can be fatal. According to a paper in THYMOS: Journal of Boyhood Studies
in 2010, 117 neonatal, circumcision-related deaths occur every year in the United States.
SIDS deaths also occur significantly more frequently amongst circumcised boys,
suggesting a connection.

Complications following circumcision are significant and numerous. At the MassGeneral
Hospital For Children, in Boston, 4.7% of all surgeries performed between 2003 and 2007
(ALL surgeries, not just pediatric surgeries) were to correct complications arising from
circumcision. Doctor M.David Gibbons of the Georgetown University School of Medicine
reported that in a two year period he was referred 275 newborns and toddlers suffering
complications as a result of neonatal circumcision.

And there are long term complications that we don't even fully understand yet. In 2006
Dr. Paul Tinari of the Pacific Institute for Advanced Study proved that circumcision
permanently alters the brain function of infants. This might explain why circumcised men
are 4.5 times more likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction, have a higher rate of suicide
and exhibit higher rates of anxiety, stress disorders, hyperactivity and attention deficit
disorder.

It's worth noting that autism rates in Europe, where most boys are uncircumcised, vary
from 1 in 1,000 to 4 in 1,000 with an even split between boys and girls. Autism rates are
14 in 1,000 in America, and the difference is made up almost entirely of circumcised
boys. Circumcised boys in America are 5 times more likely to be diagnosed with autism
than uncircumcised boys in Europe.

I'd also like to rebutt claims that circumcision protects from disease. It does not.

The CDC bases claims that circumcision protects against HIV using results from three
African clinical trials, none of which were completed and which lost 700 participants -
enough to totally reverse the claimed findings of those studies.

It is also worth noting that the African trials ONLY showed protection for men who had
heterosexual sex with women. In the United States, 90% of those infected with HIV
every year are men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users, or women. Even
according to the African trials, none of these people would be protected from HIV by
circumcision.

A better "clinical trial" would be to compare HIV rates in Europe, where men are largely
uncircumcised, to those in the United States, where men are largely circumcised. In
2011, the United States had 41% MORE HIV infections, TOTALLY INVALIDATING THE
CLAIM THAT CIRCUMCISION PROTECTS AGAINST HIV.

Claims that circumcision protects against HPV are false. A paper in the Journal of the
American Osteopathic Association reports that circumcision merely helps the virus pass
through the body more quickly - rates of genital warts from HPV are the same in
circumcised and uncircumcised men.

Circumcision does not offer any protection from gonorrhea, or syphilis.

Claims that circumcision protects against Chlamydia come from a study in which female
partners of circumcised men from conservative, highly religious Muslim countries were
compared against female partners of uncircumcised men from more sexually liberated
countries, making the results questionable.

Claims that circumcised penises are cleaner are also COMPLETELY FALSE. According to a
study performed in the UK, circumcised boys were 70% more likely to experience
balanitis than uncircumcised boys.

American claims that 1% of all uncircumcised boys will require a circumcision later in life
is deeply, ethically flawed. In Finland, only 1 in 16,000 uncircumcised boys requires
corrective circumcision; suggesting that American doctors are recommending a treatment
of last resort in the first instance.

I could go on, but hopefully you will see that there is SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE
demonstrating that the CDC's recommendations are based on FLAWED FIGURES.

There are arguably no "benefits" to circumcision and it carries many significant risks. It is
a negligence of the highest order for the CDC to claim that the "benefits outweigh the
risks" and this recommendation needs to be reversed IMMEDIATELY.

If you wish to verify the claims I have made here, I outline everything in more depth in
my book:

In closing, I'll say this: Why is the United States of America one of the only developed
nations to state that "the benefits outweigh the risks" with male circumcision?

UK, France, Finland, Denmark - EVERY OTHER developed nation in the world, in fact -
has judged from the same evidence that the "benefits" do not outweigh the risks. In fact,
in Denmark and Germany there is talk of banning the procedure. They use the same
facts, but reach the opposite conclusion.

This proposal reflects a dangerous mix of bad science and strong cultural organization to support its harmful practices.

Imagine if a Somalian medical organization sent a group of researchers to the United States to recruit adult women to undergo removal of parts of their clitoral hoods (prepuces), labia minora, or some other part of their genitals. Then, they watched these women for a few months to see if they acquired HIV less often than their counterpart women who did not have their genitals altered. Very few Americans would consider this reasonable. We are blinded by our culture.

This "science" has never proved that circumcising is going to prevent a man from getting HIV. Firstly, we know that this claim is absolutely impossible. HIV is transmitted by sexual intercourse and the exchange of body fluids. Circumcision does not prevent this. Many circumcised men have HIV. That is simple and obvious. It is right in front of our eyes. These studies showed a less than 2% reduction in the rate of HIV acquisition in a very short follow-up after the surgery was performed. These African men had surgery on their penises with a mandatory minimum 6-week period of abstinence and visited health clinics in which they were getting sex education and condoms. It is no wonder they acquired less sexually transmitted diseases. No long-term follow-up has been done to show if these differences remained. And even if they had, it doesn't matter. HIV can be prevented. But not by circumcision.

The promotion by our culture of the removal of healthy, functional, sexual, sensitive tissue makes it so clear that we are just as blind as the people in the other countries who are cutting their little girls. Look at the recommendations of all the other medical organizations in the developed world. They don't recommend circumcision because it is harmful and it is not a valid medical procedure.

The reason our little girls in this country remain intact is because our instincts to protect them have remained intact. The fact that scientific studies and organizational guidelines promoting male circumcision are being supported shows us how much our instincts to protect our boys have been lost.

It is unethical to use fear to coerce people into complying with social norms. It is not okay to cut your children's healthy genitals.

What the CDC should be recommending to counselors is that water can clean any human body part that becomes "dirty" and that condoms prevent stds including HIV better than mutilating the penis. 80% of the world's males are intact and seem to be ok with that, suffering no mass problems either keeping their foreskins clean or operational. Circumcision is an irreversible operation that only benefits doctor's bank accounts, weird companies that make millions off pilfered foreskins to make facial cream and sick people who like to deny body integrity to infant males who are powerless to object. This decision appears to come out of the era of Dr. Harvey Kellogg, the 19th century quack who thought circumcision was the cure for masterbation which he theorized caused everything from acne to epilepsy. He was sex aversive-never touching his own wife sexually.
The CDC seems to ignore the work of Dr. John Taylor, who found that the foreskin not only protects the glans but has specialized cells that enhance sexual pleasure as well as offer some immune system benefits. The foreskin is not a mistake.

Benefits enjoyed by males who are intact (not circumcised)

1. Full penis length and circumference. The "prepuce" (foreskin) constitutes 50% or more of the skin system of the penis

2. Protection. The sleeve of tissue known as the foreskin normally covers the glans and protects it from abrasion, drying, callusing (keratinization), and environmental contaminants. It keeps the glans moist and sensitive.

3. Ridged bands. The inner foreskin contains bands of densely innervated, sexually responsive tissue [1]. They constitute a primary erogenous zone of the human penis and are important for realizing the fullness and intensity of sexual response.

4. Gliding action. The foreskin is the only moving part of the penis. During any sexual activity, the foreskin and glans work in unison; their mutual interaction creates a complete sexual response.

5. Specialized sensory tissue. In addition to the "ridged bands" mentioned above, thousands of coiled fine-touch receptors (Meissners corpuscles) constitute the most important sensory component of the penis [1]. The foreskin contains branches of the dorsal nerve and between 10,000 and 20,000 specialized erotogenic nerve endings of several types, which are capable of sensing slight motion and stretch, subtle changes in temperature, and fine gradations in texture.

6. The frenulum. This is a highly nerve-laden web of tissue that tethers the inner foreskin to the underside of the glans [see photo]. It is similar to the frenula found under the tongue, the upper lip and the clitoral hood (female foreskin). For many intact men, the penile frenulum is a male "G-spot" that is highly pleasurable .

7. Proper blood flow. The foreskin contains several feet of blood vessels, including the frenular artery and branches of the dorsal artery. The loss of this rich vascularization interrupts normal blood flow to the shaft and glans of the penis, damaging the natural function of the penis and altering its development.

8. Immunological defense. The soft mucosa of the inner foreskin produces plasma cells, which secrete immunoglobulin antibodies, and antibacterial and antiviral proteins [7, 14], such as the pathogen-killing enzyme called lysozyme [15 and see explanation].

9. Langerhans cells. These specialized epithelial cells are a component of the immune system and may play a role in protecting the penis from sexually transmitted infections such as HIV (AIDS)

10. Proper lymph flow. The foreskin contains lymphatic vessels, which are necessary for proper lymph flow and immunological functioning.

11. Estrogen receptors. The foreskin contains estrogen receptors, whose purpose is not yet fully understood and needs further study.

12. Apocrine glands. These glands produce pheromones, natures invisible yet compelling signals to potential sexual partners. The effect of their absence on human sexual behavior has never been studied.

13. Sebaceous glands. The oils produced by these glands lubricate and moisturize the foreskin and glans, so that the two structures function together smoothly.

14. Dartos fascia. This is a smooth muscle sheath that underlies the scrotum, the entire penis and the tip of the foreskin. It is necessary for proper temperature regulation of the genitals (causing these structures to elongate in the heat and shrink in the cold). Approximately half of the Dartos fascia is destroyed by circumcision.

Circumcision is a permanent surgical subtraction that can cause infection, sexual reassignment, death and diminished human maternal bonding. Routine infant circumcision denies the male freedom of choice and the right to an intact body.

The foreskin is necessary for optimal health and well-being of the male, as well as contributing to fulfillment
in his sexual relationships.</td></tr><tr><td>459</td><td></td><td></td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0459'>Permalink</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>460</td><td>Glaychia Reber</td><td>Dec 8, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0460'>Permalink</a></td><td>I feel embarrassed to say that I once trusted an organization who now proposes that medical providers suggest routine infant circumcision as a preventative measure for sexually transmitted diseases.

Above all, it fails properly to take account the child's right to autonomy.

CDC seeks safeguard the practice of circumcision as a "parental choice" while seeking to regulate that parents be counselled of the supposed benefts. Even were non-therapeutic circumcision to be a reasonable matter for parental choice, it is a coercive counselling that overstates the benefits, minimises the risks and denies the harms.

HPV is a sexually transmitted virus responsible for genital warts leading to cervical cancer and penile cancer, for which there are now two vaccines (Gardasil and Cervarix). According to the CDC: "Gardasil protects males against most genital warts. This vaccine is also recommended and available for boys and men, 9 through 26 years of age."

HIV can now be prevented with a high rate of success through the use of the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis drug known as Truvada. According to the CDC website: "Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is a way for people who do not have HIV but who are at substantial risk of getting it to prevent HIV infection" and "PrEP has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people who are at high risk by up to 92%."

Since there are many non-invasive ways to prevent sexually transmitted infections (limiting sexual partners, proper hygiene, condoms, and now vaccines) there is no rational or ethical reason for CDC to condone or encourage parents who want to have their infant sons' healthy genitals surgically altered for 'disease prevention'. Rather, CDC guidelines should stress to healthcare providers that they have an ethical obligation to remind parents of these less radical, less risky, non-surgical alternatives and to not participate in such surgeries.</td></tr><tr><td>467</td><td>Patty Jula</td><td>Dec 8, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0467'>Permalink</a></td><td>The CDC should recommend condom use over cutting off body parts.

The movement's latest claims seem to center around sexual feeling and sensation, so I wanted to provide a researched counterbalance here.
The Kigozi study in Uganda, 2008 ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18086100 ) is a well known randomized controlled trial of 4000+ men and found no difference after monitoring for two years after the procedure. A study by Dr. John Krieger ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3042320/ ), another controlled trial, found similar satisfaction in Kenya with around 2,700 participants. 64% of those circumcised actually reported more sensitivity than before, and 54.5% reported greater ease of reaching orgasm. I mention these because they're the the most accurate studies done to date on the subject. Smaller studies with questionable funding (NOCIRC, etc) should always fall under scrutiny. These pop up and are proven invalid with some regularity.
While surveys are always less reliable due to their subjective nature, I'd call your attention to one based on its size (10,000 participants) as well as its location, Germany, a country which can be shown to have no cultural bias towards the procedure. The authors of the survey ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23361453 ) reached this conclusion: "Based on the present study which represents the largest survey worldwide on male ED using the IIEF as a validated instrument, it could not be confirmed that the prevalence of ED is increased in men following circumcision. Sexual satisfaction of men in this study was independent of the presence of the prepuce."
The unverified and anecdotal 'greater sensitivity' touted by anti-circ activists has, therefore, failed to translate into greater pleasure during sex in any large, credible study. In fact the opposite has been found.

Do not advocate that baby boys be strapped down at have a part of their body chopped off shortly after birth because one study says it might reduce the risk of HIV. Condoms are much more effective than circumcision, and they do not leave a permanent scar and loss of sensitivity. It is also possible that people who are circumcised might view condoms as less of a necessity if they believe that they are protected from HIV. Of course like any surgery, circumcision has risks. The list of complications is extensive and includes things like death and loss of the penis. Please, do not advocate for circumcision. Mutilation of baby boys is a horrible practice that needs to stop. Focus your resources on sex education and condom use. It will have a much greater effect.</td></tr><tr><td>474</td><td>Michael Rosas</td><td>Dec 8, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0474'>Permalink</a></td><td>As an educator, I am all for spreading good and reliable knowledge. However, the CDC is proposing spreading unreliable (weak) information. It appears that more of a religious/cultural belief is being spread (and imposed on others) than information based on sound scientific evidence. Every male neonate, young child, teenager, and adult should be protected from unnecessary harm. Moreover, the CDC and AAP should be held accountable (legally) for any man that feels harmed by his circumcision (including intact males that have to deal with the medical community's obsession with cutting male genitals). I think it's time that us men fight for our bodies! This proposal is tasteless and disrespectful.</td></tr><tr><td>475</td><td>Marsha Epstein MD MPH</td><td>Dec 8, 2014</td><td><a href='http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC-2014-0012-0475'>Permalink</a></td><td>I support male circumcision as a sound medical practice based upon scientific evidence.
